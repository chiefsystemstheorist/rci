<p>	The Internet basically democratized a lot of things. It reduced the information assymmetry, but we're creating content at an unimaginable rate and it's hard ot chose what to consume. 
    Lists are the new search and the aggregation theory applies to zomato as well. Lol</p>
<br><a href"https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2016/1/31/lists-are-the-new-search">lists are the new search</a> 
<br>"all curation grows until it requires search and all search grows until it requires curation."
<br>It's hard to say, if we need more curation[3] or better search[2], but feeds are all lists.

<br>[1] leave 100s of tabs open for days/ weeks - <a href="https://www.notion.so/manublj/a8ed8f719e1d4cb683829e789c2c5245?v=8b6d0fe10d884145b91b19c818b91c86">tweets as validation</a>
<br>[2] hoard articles to read from feeds/newsletters and usual browsing

<br>opening new tabs(thought-trains) is the default behaviour.
<br>\[\[c0 clipboards &amp; interfaces\]\] -- browser
<br>    [1] It is not about reading the content of one page and going on to the next. 
<br>        It is about gathering the relevant data in the sea of nonsense, and leaving the tabs open, «in working  memory», until the gathered data 
<br>        // All the tabs that are open are not open because people forget to close them.
<br>       Instead, they act like living bookmarks. 
<br>       They are keys to thoughts and ideas, that you want to return to and continue thinking.

<br>We consume content through (newsletters and social-networks) and (through browsing)
<br>Feeds and newsletters are people and publishers we subscribe to
<br>	
<br>	some of us hoard articles to read from feeds/ newsletters and usual browsing.
<br>	It seems you'll start dumping articles into read-later apps, just-in-case you need it later. And so far, pocket/ instapaper/ diigo and other major players only have a chronological feed of links saved [home-feed].
<br>	Users are frustrated, they cannot keep with their hoarding habit.




<br>It's hard to know which ones are worthwhile before consuming it, but it suddenly hit me that at that point we bookmarked it, we have various reasons for why we bookmark ?

<br>	As end-consumers we consume a lot of diverse content across a number of platforms, but bookmarking is an inherent behaviour in users. 
<br> why we bookmark ? <a href="https://bytebaker.com/2010/10/05/why-bookmark/">link</a>

1) Bookmarking an item seems to be a very good way to remember stuff, even if you’re never going to look at the bookmark again. Just categorizing a bookmarking with tags, and thinking shortly about it, lets me remember most of the stuff I put in there.
2) Read Later buffer
3) Sharing. Bookmarking an item lets me share it with a lot of people, some of whom are friends, some I know from the web, and some I know not all. I’ve made handful of acquaintances with people with very much the same interests as me.

I tried to list out reasons I bookmarked
<br>	we have a various reasons why we want to those links (urls)	    
<br>3 buckets - unread, read, just-in-case 
<br>    (1) unread - seems interesting (just-in-case)(just open it in background and leave it to rot)
<br>	(2)	unread / half-read - Things you want to get back to, like for sure. 
<br>	(3) read - text that makes you say "nobody put it this way" (indexing) - for future reference \[read or started reading\] 

<br>prioritizing the unread-links in home-feed
<br>    (0) primary goal = sort/ filter/ prioritize feed. the list - curating yourself. 

<br>	For quickly deciding what to read and what to skip. 
<br>	helps the algorithm which are more of a priority and which ones you could to miss out
<br>	In this Lists ([[<a href="benevan.html">Lists are the new SEARCH</a>]]), it's not signal v. noise.
<br>	Almost always every article might be equally interesting and you'll be having a hard time saying no to it.
<br>    since by default everything that comes inside the reading app is chosen by you, 
<br>    by default everything that comes in is considered a signal, and it's our job to figure which ones might be a great read.


<br>At the time of bookmarking itself we can ask him for inputs ? we might get to know how important it is to him.
<br>when the user gives contextual inputs like for the author, for the blog, for the headline, all three.,, or something similar, that tries to capture as much info as possible for the algorithm to decide how important it is to the user,, it becomes easier to prioritize.
<br> Sometimes so clear that they have to set aside time to read this, they go on to schedule it on their calendar app.



<br>establish intent clearly before getting it inside the information system (i.e, Pocket)
<br>adding weights based on who wrote it (or) blog name (or) no. of upvotes it got from ppl you follow

<br>Web pages that we visit and leave open are artifacts of externalized cognition; keys to thinking and remembering.
<br>The browser of today is a transitory space that brings us into a mental state, not just to a specific website destination. And we should design our browsers for this task.

            
<br>Can make those with lots of tabs trying to organize them, do it faster by asking them to bookmark all tabs —> import to us —> sort it out here (new thread, add to old thread, delete tab) I closed a few tabs today. I think I’m finally making progress- I’m only at 104 open as of today.
    
    [[t1 tabocalypse & browser]]

<br>	These reading apps also have an explore-feed, as in social-networks but these are considered utility apps and no one is exploiting it properly.
