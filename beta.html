<br>Trying to understand the origins of the hundreds of links unread, lying dead in our Pocket/ Instapaper and all the other links that got bookmarked, but didn't make it to the read-later app.
<br>- /surfing/ All those links you saved, come from one of these places.
<br>This is how the list is created [[DISCOVERY]].
<br>[a] // DISCOVERY---|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>(1) newsletters
<br>(2) feeds - twitter, linkedin, reddit, tumblr, instagram, facebook.etc
<br>(3) browser /surfing/ (power users - research driven education)
<br>3.1|-----from Goggle's SERP
<br>3.2|-----through backlinks t1 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>Content from these lists are bookmarked and pulled to another consumption app, reading app to read later or to shelf it.
<br>[1] prioritize                  - unread    -  everything else that comes inside the reading app
<br>[2] use for curation and search - read      -    "nobody put it this way"
<br>everything is a list
<br>FOMO on missing out on the tweets of a certain set of people is a strong reason to make content viewable as lists, as in twitter. lists based on topics/niches.
<br>We've invested in lists in twitter, likewise this behaviour could be applied across platforms to prioritize your content queue.

<br>These are the controls social-media platforms come with. 
<br>It's just that social-platforms don't yet realize that using these controls itself will help reduce this overwhelming feeling that we're drowing in the content overload.
<br> acknowledging the fact that the user is the curator (people and publishers I follow) and that he could do better. 




<br>We consume content through (newsletters and social-networks) and (through browsing)
<br>Feeds and newsletters are people and publishers we subscribe to
<br>They actually control who they follow, who follows them (and how they influence the people who follow them), things they wouldn't want to miss out (FOMO),.. ultimately the quality of the feed.
<br>through engagements like - follow button, unfollow button, like, upvote, downvote, report and more. give money button(in CH) is this new thing that's gonna blow everyone out of the field. Whoever can get creators paid best will be ruling.

<br>prioritizing the home-feed
<br>There's too much content content and it's hard to know which ones are worthwhile before consuming it.
<br>/1/ adding weights(domain authority) for better prioritizing led me to think saving is indexing and engaging is ranking
<br>indexing properly from the beginning might actually control the inflow of information in the system [enter Google as a search engine & Browser (The Internet), Twitter, Instagram, conversations in Clubhouse]  

<br>establish intent clearly before getting it inside the information system (i.e, Pocket)
<br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New idea from a blog post that has been on my mind a lot the last month: that info overload is not due to filter failure, but filter success. Everything is so good now (or at least alluring) it’s hard to turn away. And having better filters only makes that problem worse</p>&mdash; Tiago Forte (@fortelabs) <a href="https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1075294724330831872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<br>At the time of bookmarking itself we can ask him for inputs ? we might get to know how important it is to him.

<br>weight / labels - author = must-read-author / must-read-blog .etc. adding weights to channels to measure authenticity and domain authority
<br>ex: article(author), tweet(techtwitter), platform(memes(friends))

<br>/2/ engaging is ranking
<br>all content posted is evaluated by us wherein we assign it values like like, share, subscribe, save, comment - based on how much we resonate with it. 
<br>even before bookmarking it, some people 
<br>like, 
<br>share/repost/retweet,(repurposing, not plagiarism //no. of mentions by links with greater authority proportional to domain-authority) 
<br>comment, 
<br>share post as story/ status <!--(this behaviour is seen in people who want to be identified as something / to make people aware (and/or) clearly for dopamine.-->
<br>users engaging is like them adding weights to posts real-time as they scroll through the feed engaging with content / ranking them. This is what is used for improving the algorithm.
<br>every piece of content has a weight attached to it by the user.  

<br>It is basically like users are telling the algorithm what they like and don't, what they want to see more of and want they're not interested in.
<br>(naturally they're giving signals, we just have to interpret them properly)














    





<!--(2)/social-capital/-->
   
    



    <br>Any social-media platform that doesn't help the user control his feed quality will suffer. 
    <br> But it'll get even worse if becoming a creator is a thing. It is already big thing for some of us, but to the average user, he just wants to look at memes, some good content, look at friends stories, talk to them, that's all. We'll see a lot of new creators in our friends circle itself. 
    <br>Due to the increasing desire of people to create content, this'll be another headache along with curating the already existing sea of content.
    <br>But after a point, someone has to solve for this content overload.  (signal v. noise)



    

    content = comments/ notes/ annotations of must-read-author on (1) articles (2) tweets, and notes on them.
    [[UGC]]    
    
    If the signal part is shown in highly noisy environments, it helps the user to better decide, if it deserves his/her attention, or even they'd be ready to give more attention to those which are pure signal.  quickly deciding what to read and what to skip.
    each UX component conveys some information to the user about either navigation  
    or

<br> [1] curation (recommendations) 	
<br>explore feed - a ton of unrelated articles. this feed is made up of everything that I'm interested in.
<br>I Don't know If you'd agree with me on this, But since every user has a UNIQUELY-shaped internal representation for each cognitive space,
<br>It is impossible for us to tell which ones he might consider as "nobody out it this way", or "I can't afford to lose this piece of gourmet shit, in the sea of content", because you never know which sentence is going to blow your mind.
<br>He would come across great articles every now and, the child in us gets excited when he sees a great article and might share it (clout) which I would.
<br>even then, it is not impossible to create a scarcity of (good articles) for the user.

    <br>	For quickly deciding what to read and what to skip. 
    <br>	helps the algorithm which are more of a priority and which ones you could to miss out
    <br>	In this Lists ([[<a href="benevan.html">Lists are the new SEARCH</a>]]), it's not signal v. noise.
    <br>	Almost always every article might be equally interesting and you'll be having a hard time saying no to it.
    <br>    since by default everything that comes inside the reading app is chosen by you, 
    <br>    by default everything that comes in is considered a signal, and it's our job to figure which ones might be a great read.

<br>The user not being able to keep up with his saving activity, and increasing load of articles which you never seem to complete, is totally unnecessary. 
<br>oh, you're getting frustrated, you can't keep up with the list, FOMO huh ?! 
<br>Fear not for all those instances you saved just-in-case won't go to the grave. 
<br>/archived, but searchable/

<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>[2] search - what clarity is, is different to different people, but for me it is being able to retrieve stuff (cognitive spaces/ mental-sessions, or it could be articles/ tweets) instantly on command.
<br>better SERPs (basic logic that my friend who knows about it can guide me better than GOOG)
<br> search in consumption app (reading app) /platform 


<br>and social-media platforms can actually bring consensus (being on the same page - alignment)  //(leaderboards)
<br>In a lot of ways, we've digitized trust and we want to hold them accountable to a certain extent.
<br>aggregators can be publishers
<!--page2 platform & leaderboards-->
<br>/<a href="/serps.html">consensus</a>/


    <br> I say we need to introduce scarcity (Eugene Wei +100). 
    <br>(1) A case for subscription only supply of scarcity. 
    <br>(2) At the same time, Ads are good, as satire cannot be paid for. confusing Ikr. But I get it, so moving on.
    
    there are 2 incentives 
    incentive for publishers to become irreplaceble here than elsewhere, as we're really serious about improving serps 
    incentive to bookmark here, as this will also make search better in the longer run
    




    
To a significant percent of users, instagram is the internet they know, or twitter is the internet they know, reddit and google is their internet, it depends from person to person. 
Hence indexing just webpages will not cut it, all file formats of content across platforms all are part of the Internet. 
articles are just one of the [file-formats](https://www.notion.so/file-formats-8e6aa86afe4349ec91a40af035a52418)




<!--(3)/browser/-->
<br>(3)/browser/    
<br>Our brain is a constant stream of thoughts and we keep jumping from train to train, from tab to tab, travelling through cognitive spaces, without losing enthusiasm, without closing it so it can rot there for the next 3 months or so, trying to find the answer to something.
<br>While reading about a topic / doing research, The user starts with one tab and as he reads the article, we tend to click on 'open in new tab' often, He'll click on 'Open in new tab often', switching tabs and , in the end there will be some 100-150 or more open tabs.
<br>for example  -
<br>this is how I google - I started with 'financial inclusion in India', 'RBI guidelines for NBFCs, Pre-paid Instruments. etc' and ended up in 'mobile money  in  Nigeria'.
<br>0 to 59 tabs in 3 windows and 2 browsera in less than an hour. somewhere in one of those 'open in new tab' clicks user will be opening links which might be a wolly new topic from what He/She was reading previously
<br>In the end, no.of threads created would be equal to the no. of& times you went down a new rabbit hole.
<br>In retrospect, You might end up with hundreds of links you found from different platforms on the internet.
<br>
<br> The browser is capable of handling 100s of tabs in multiple windows, but  isn't  it  a  clusterfuck  ?!  current  solutions  seem  like  a  joke.

(a)[1] controlling the filth
<br>feed cleansing - unfollowing regularly leads to a quality feed.

<br> this is my bet - just like everyone else, we need to create scarcity. 

<br>we could try to simulate a scarcity of oppurtunities.

<br> make it look like there's an abundance of oppurtunities, unlike the scarcity of it's supply in the real-world.

</a> Published: 01 February 2010 12:20 
<br> " But becoming ‘microfamous’ puts people at the centre of an uncomfortable social dynamic. As Danny said:
<br>There are people out there who know something about you, but you have relatively little knowledge about them.
<br>This becomes problematic because the microfamous rarely have the resources that the truly famous do to protect their privacy. But more importantly, it creates a disconnect, an unbalanced power relationship that we don’t really have the societal experience to understand. Knowledge is, after all, power."

I see a lot of people having a workflow make sure they get the most out of whatever they read example
    a tweet -->b "@readwise save thread", and readwise will save that tweet -->center, spaced repetition.-->d note-taking tools integrating with spaced repetition to import excerpts and highlights. (example - readwise to roam-research.inc)
