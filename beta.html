    <br>opening new tabs(thought-trains) is the default behaviour.
    <br>\[\[c0 clipboards &amp; interfaces\]\] -- browser
    <br>    [1] It is not about reading the content of one page and going on to the next. 
    <br>        It is about gathering the relevant data in the sea of nonsense, and leaving the tabs open, «in working  memory», until the gathered data 
    <br>        // All the tabs that are open are not open because people forget to close them.
    <br>       Instead, they act like living bookmarks. 
    <br>       They are keys to thoughts and ideas, that you want to return to and continue thinking.

    <br>    I get more links from newsletters than through social-media platforms, and since, it's not like all good content was written recently, we keep resurfacing older but quality links. This only proves that how old is not a parameter.
    
    <br>
    <br>
 

    <br> This is what will control the incoming links, not  curation. 



















<br>Feeds and newsletters are people and publishers we subscribe to



        
   


These links came in the funnel of the people you follow, and they thought that it's worth sharing and by chance the algorithm showed it to you, and now you are saving it and [validating it]
Assume that the links saved by you, which are shared by/ written by, -(people you consider to be the greatest among all those you follow) -
might be given more weightage in the Feed. 








>triaging / prioritzing articles    
   -  sort by - signals 
   (1) reading time (or) no. of words and show if <1500 words (short read) or >1500 (long read) ..etc accordingly, 
   (2) author 
   (3) rank domains of saved articles based on no. of read and/or upvoted articles user has from that domain
   
   Idk about frequency, but using the source of link as signal for prioritizing links seems really cool. Now how to track the source ? we can suggest the user to add source / recommended from/by as tag and explain how it'd help in prioritizing. — or or as the user connects his twitter, it'll show all those who have retweeted/quote tweeted/replied this tweet and this'll help in prioritizing. or maybe it is technically possible to fetch the link to the tweet / mail / article that had the link to this article
   
   -   priority level as in Apple reminders app — !!!, !!, !
   -   re-read tag
   -   snooze tag
   -   highlights of an article to choose whether to read it or not
   -    make them create a new tag 'read whatever comes from this source' (author/newsletter/blog), this way they can concentrate on finishing those first and they won't miss out on the must-reads
    - should have 'date added' for links
    - add a saved link to your google calendar on a free slot
    - reading in progress tag
    - queue like a music player where you can rearrange articles and read in the order you wish, instead of having latest on top
    - experiment - limit saving upto 10 links, then complete short-form articles to save more
    - Save as PDF file and progress by completing pages per day, maybe. 
    - daily saved summary - comes up as push notification
    send push notification reminder every morning with an article to read (or) maybe, ask them when they'll be free everyday and send them in that time... maybe just before they go to sleep

>other important stuff to note
- Instapaper will download a text-view version of any article you save, even when it doesn't make sense. So, Parsing mukkiyam bigil-uh. 
   Reader mode should be like in safari browser
- highlights like in instapaper or play books (choose wisely)
- save read position
- swipe / tap to change page


	
>saving tweets and tweetstorms

- twitter threads unrolled and saved as single article
- meta-thread of some of user's favourite Twitter threads

Tweet Alchemy —- compile / synthesize tweets to form an argument Synthesizing simply means combining. Instead of summarizing the main points of each source in turn, you put together the ideas and findings of multiple sources in order to make an overall point.[https://www.simplypsychology.org/synthesising.html]

highlighting is at the core of the system. highlights of an article, gives the reader a mental picture of what he learnt.

With more users, we can show the most highlighted parts of each article as signal to help users decide which ones are worth reading for them.

comments on the article will also be shown in the reader, as they are important tools which might help readers form opinions, give them a new perspective .etc
[[cultivating comments across platforms & ultimately communities]]
#metrics/stats 



Searching through the articles that came through our users discovery funnel, ranking all the domains we have collected from users and find where the good stuff is on the internet, niche-wise.

<br>We've invested in lists in twitter, likewise this behaviour could be applied across platforms to prioritize your content queue.

<br><h3>This is how the list is created [[DISCOVERY]].</h3> - /surfing/ All those links you saved, come from one of these places.

<br>Content from these lists are bookmarked and pulled to another consumption app, reading app to read later or to shelf it.
<br>[1] prioritize                  - unread    -  everything else that comes inside the reading app
<br>[2] use for curation and search - read      -    "nobody put it this way"
