    <br>    [2] hoard articles to read from feeds/newsletters and usual browsing
    <br>	some of us hoard articles to read from feeds/ newsletters and usual browsing.
    <br>	Users are frustrated, they cannot keep with their hoarding habit.
    <br>
    <br>Trying to understand the origins of the hundreds of links unread, lying dead in our Pocket/ Instapaper and all the other links that got bookmarked, but didn't make it to the read-later app.
    <br>
    <br>[a] // DISCOVERY---|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <br>(1) newsletters
    <br>(2) feeds - twitter, linkedin, reddit, tumblr, instagram, facebook.etc
    <br>(3) browser /surfing/ (power users - research driven education)
    <br>3.1|-----from Goggle's SERP
    <br>3.2|-----through backlinks t1 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <br>
    <br>     publisher's point of view,
    <br>    they have to keep posting consistently according to the algorithm of that social-media platform to be shown in more no. of feeds (feeds of users who might find it relevant), (Feed)
    <br>    they have to keep ranking better for getting traffic to their webpage (SERPS)
    <br>    but having an email-id is like having a direct relationship with the consumer.
    <br> I get more links from newsletters than through social-media platforms, and since, it's not like all good content was written recently, we keep resurfacing older but quality links. This only proves that how old is not a parameter.
    <br> It seems as if we bookmark them and read them as we come across as it in social-media platforms, but in reality, some users religiously follow content from certain people and publishers through their feeds(will have post notifs on) and newsletters. They don't go to the website directly, they get their content through social-media platforms and newsletters.
    <br> But (1) in social-media platforms, publisher's posts might get lost in the feed and (2) even though they have a direct relationship with consumer through newsletter, some users consume it all in a standalone app for reading.
    <br>    as the content overload is increasing, to keep up with all this content, the user has to acknowledge that, pocket zero is unreal unlike inbox zero.
    <br>


    <br>We consume content through (newsletters and social-networks) and (through browsing)
    <br> you may get your links from anywhere, but there are some people who use reading apps, the final destination where they consume the content they saved for later.
    <br>	content is consumed wherever it is posted, but long form content like articles and newsletters are being consumed in a standalone reading app. people read newsletters directly in the mail app / tab, but there are signs of people who want a place specifically dedicated for reading. (for those with high attention spans)

    <br>	<!--after saving-->
    <br>	But Pocket is a dump.
    <br>	\[1\] Most never go back to them. Links are dying everyday.
    <br>	It seems you'll start dumping articles into read-later apps, just-in-case you need it later. And so far, pocket/ instapaper/ diigo and other major players only have a chronological feed of links saved [home-feed].
<br> This is what will control the incoming links, not  curation. 
<br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A Substack of carefully selected links and analysis is helpful, but not if everyone is pushing one.<br><br>Curation is content in itself, masked as a service.</p>&mdash; Matt Klein (@KleinKleinKlein) <a href="https://twitter.com/KleinKleinKlein/status/1340751191572135941?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 20, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<br><br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New idea from a blog post that has been on my mind a lot the last month: that info overload is not due to filter failure, but filter success.

<br>Feeds and newsletters are people and publishers we subscribe to


        
   
<br>	Reading apps are where a set of people go to first thing they open their phone. They have this guilt they're not able to finish things they save and that pocket / instapaper are dumps.
everyone came there for a reason and eventually they have to realize more reasons to come there.
they get in through notifications (internal-triggers) and gradually they open it first thing they open the device. [[CJ]]
as network effects kick in, it'd start looking like all the people you give a fuck about will be there. I mean we joined every social-platform because our friends did, and then for the content. vice-versa is also true.


These links came in the funnel of the people you follow, and they thought that it's worth sharing and by chance the algorithm showed it to you, and now you are saving it and [validating it]
Assume that the links saved by you, which are shared by/ written by, -(people you consider to be the greatest among all those you follow) -
might be given more weightage in the Feed. 







we all are status seeing monkeys. we keep judging things as higher in status and either become an admirer or envy it, and start thinking, how to perform better to reach higher status. \[\[nerds - creator monetization = HIGHER STATUS (social capital)\]\] v. \[\[noobs - potential paying user personas\]\]

stats for gamification is not simply taking your product and adding points, levels, trophies, and badges. Well, researchers distinguished intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. With intrinsic motivation, we do things because we find them inherently satisfying and interesting. With extrinsic motivation, we do things to achieve rewards. And that’s the problem with rewards – they massively undermine intrinsic motivation. This is also why gamification does not work. When gamification appears to work, it is because the underlying experience is already a game.

<br>We've invested in lists in twitter, likewise this behaviour could be applied across platforms to prioritize your content queue. 

<br> power-users can relate these excerpts ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<!--before saving-->

<br>/1/	and bookmarks are basically the internet I set aside for later consumption and power-users foldering bookmarks seems like users are creating an index for their bookmarks.
<br>	I understood users themselves are actually INDEXING by saving it somewhere and they feel guilty for not going back to it. FOMO. [[<a href="jit.html">just-in-case v. just-in-time</a>]]
Indexing is being done by the reader himself, as he is basically weaving his demonstrable understanding, by naming the space properly during consumption itself (write one-liner), making collections of links about topics he knows in depth.
I mean them foldering a post a giving it a name itself could be considered as indexing.
