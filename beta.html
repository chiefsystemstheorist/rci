    <br>-- observed-behaviours --

<br> [1] leave 100s of tabs open for days/ weeks.
<br> [2] hoard articles and never get back to them.
<br> Users are frustrated, they cannot keep up with their hoarding habit.
<br>
<br> From the publisher's PoV, (publisher's = individual creators (people) and pages)

<br> [] They have to keep posting (that too consistently) according to the algorithm of that aggregator to get picked up by the algorithm, to be shown in more no. of feeds (feeds of users who might find it relevant). Also, in social-media platforms, publisher's posts might get lost in the feed. [[n1]]
<br> Hence, Newsletters > having to get ranked in a feed (social-media platforms and SERPs). 
     Email is a direct relationship with the reader. 
<br>
<br> still, when it comes to the overload, newsletters are just one channel. 
<br>
<br>We get our links from one of these 3 places - Feeds(social-meida platforms), Newsletters, Browsing(SERPs and backlinks). { Feeds =  twitter, linkedin, reddit, tumblr, instagram, facebook.etc }
<br>
<br> [] And readers don't go to the website(or social-media page of that publisher) directly, They'd read it either in the feed itself (or) mail app itself (or) save it for later. Content is consumed wherever it is posted, but long form content like articles and newsletters are mostly saved for later. You may get your links from anywhere, but for some people, reading apps are the final destination where they consume the content they saved for later. #1
<br>
<br> People submit their sites to google for it to crawl, index and serve it to end-users.
<br> [1] On the other hand, bookmarks are basically the internet I set aside for later consumption #2
     [2] and power-users foldering bookmarks seems like users are creating an index for their bookmarks.
<br> Indexing is being done by the reader himself, as he is basically weaving his demonstrable understanding, by naming the space properly during consumption itself, making collections of links about topics he knows in depth. This is just my observation.

<br>    And, the use of query-modifiers is enough validation that, Google is not serving quality content. It has more generic SEO-centric content in it SERPs.
<br><a href="https://dcgross.com/a-new-google">A New Google - dcgross.com | December 2020</a>
<br>
<br><p style="color:red;"> search in consumption app (reading app) /platform </p>
better SERPs (basic logic that my friend who knows about it can guide me better than GOOG)

<br>    As the content overload is increasing, to keep up with all this content, the user has to acknowledge that, <br>(1) pocket zero is unreal unlike inbox zero, (2) be cautious of what you bring inside the system.

<br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A Substack of carefully selected links and analysis is helpful, but not if everyone is pushing one.<br><br>Curation is content in itself, masked as a service.</p>&mdash; Matt Klein (@KleinKleinKlein) <a href="https://twitter.com/KleinKleinKlein/status/1340751191572135941?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 20, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New idea from a blog post that has been on my mind a lot the last month: that info overload is not due to filter failure, but filter success. Everything is so good now (or at least alluring) it’s hard to turn away. And having better filters only makes that problem worse</p>&mdash; Tiago Forte (@fortelabs) <a href="https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1075294724330831872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<br>
<br> This is what will control the incoming links, not curation. 
<br><p style="color:red;">index / bookmark | \[1\] [UIC] - home feed (what is now chronological).</p>
<br> curation is the problem of the century 
<br>/<a href="/beta.html">prioritize</a>/ for a better reading experience.

<br>	As end-consumers we consume a lot of diverse content across a number of platforms, but bookmarking is an inherent behaviour in users. 
<br> why we bookmark ? <a href="https://bytebaker.com/2010/10/05/why-bookmark/">link</a>

1) Bookmarking an item seems to be a very good way to remember stuff, even if you’re never going to look at the bookmark again. Just categorizing a bookmarking with tags, and thinking shortly about it, lets me remember most of the stuff I put in there.
2) Read Later buffer
3) Sharing. Bookmarking an item lets me share it with a lot of people, some of whom are friends, some I know from the web, and some I know not all. I’ve made handful of acquaintances with people with very much the same interests as me.

I tried to list out reasons I bookmarked
<br>	we have a various reasons why we want to those links (urls)	    
<br>3 buckets - unread, read, just-in-case 
<br>    (1) unread - seems interesting (just-in-case)(just open it in background and leave it to rot)
<br>	(2)	unread / half-read - Things you want to get back to, like for sure. 
<br>	(3) read - text that makes you say "nobody put it this way" (indexing) - for future reference \[read or started reading\] 

<br>prioritizing the unread-links in home-feed
<br>    (0) primary goal = sort/ filter/ prioritize feed. the list - curating yourself.

<br>opening new tabs(thought-trains) is the default behaviour.
<br>\[\[c0 clipboards &amp; interfaces\]\] -- browser
<br>    [1] It is not about reading the content of one page and going on to the next. 
<br>        It is about gathering the relevant data in the sea of nonsense, and leaving the tabs open, «in working  memory», until the gathered data 
<br>        // All the tabs that are open are not open because people forget to close them.
<br>       Instead, they act like living bookmarks. 
<br>       They are keys to thoughts and ideas, that you want to return to and continue thinking.
<br>
<br> Web pages that we visit and leave open are artifacts of externalized cognition; keys to thinking and remembering.
<br> The browser of today is a transitory space that brings us into a mental state, not just to a specific website destination. And we should design our browsers for this task.


<!--after saving-->
<!-- solving for the overload -->
<br>
<br>	\[1\] Most never go back to them. Links are dying everyday.
<br>	It seems you'll start dumping articles into read-later apps, just-in-case you need it later. And so far, pocket/ instapaper/ diigo and other major players only have a chronological feed of links saved [home-feed].

<br>	Users getting frustrated due to FOMO on the increasing load of articles which they never seem to complete, is totally unnecessary.
<br>	// tweets as validation
<br>The user not being able to keep up with his saving activity, and increasing load of articles which you never seem to complete, is totally unnecessary. 
<br>oh, you're getting frustrated, you can't keep up with the list, FOMO huh ?! 
<br>Fear not for all those instances you saved just-in-case won't go to the grave.

<!--<br> I'm only building this for me to use. I have a problem that I face. I'll try to check if a lot of people go through a similar experience. 
<br> And How do I do this ? -->
<br> (1) The byproduct of the pursuit of a great product idea, is the content or more like copy, you could use for distribution, to build conviction. 
<br> (2) A beta-list maybe. Build a killer feature-set based on the problems I face, (because anything novel will be totally different/ radical than what was before hence you'd need to design everything from scratch) <!--and if the market validates, I mean if there is traction, I can start running the machine.-->
