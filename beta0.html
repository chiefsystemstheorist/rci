    <br>-- observed-behaviours --

<br> [1] leave 100s of tabs open for days/ weeks.
<br> [2] hoard articles and never get back to them.
<br> Users are frustrated, they cannot keep up with their hoarding habit.
<br>
<br> From the publisher's PoV, (publisher's = individual creators (people) and pages)

<br> [] They have to keep posting (that too consistently) according to the algorithm of that aggregator to get picked up by the algorithm, to be shown in more no. of feeds (feeds of users who might find it relevant). Also, in social-media platforms, publisher's posts might get lost in the feed. [[n1]]
<br> Hence, Newsletters > having to get ranked in a feed (social-media platforms and SERPs). 
     Email is a direct relationship with the reader. 
<br>
<br> still, when it comes to the overload, newsletters are just one channel. 
<br>
<br>We get our links from one of these 3 places - 
<br> [1] Feeds(social-meida platforms), { Feeds =  twitter, linkedin, reddit, tumblr, instagram, facebook.etc }
<br> [2] Newsletters, 
<br> [3] Browsing(SERPs and backlinks). 
<br>
<br> [] Readers don't go to the website(or social-media page of that publisher) directly, They'd read it either in the feed itself (or) mail app itself (or) save it for later. Content is consumed wherever it is posted, but long form content like articles and newsletters are mostly saved for later. You may get your links from anywhere, but for some people, reading apps are the final destination where they consume the content they saved for later. #1
<br>
<br> People submit their sites to google for it to crawl, index and serve it to end-users.
<br> [1] On the other hand, bookmarks are basically the internet I set aside for later consumption #2
     [2] and power-users foldering bookmarks seems like users are creating an index for their bookmarks.
<br> Indexing is being done by the reader himself, as he is basically weaving his demonstrable understanding, by naming the space properly during consumption itself, making collections of links about topics he knows in depth. This is just my observation.
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>    And, the use of query-modifiers is enough validation that, Google is not serving quality content. It has more generic SEO-centric content in it SERPs.
<br><a href="https://dcgross.com/a-new-google">A New Google - dcgross.com | December 2020</a>
<br>
<br><p style="color:red;"> search in consumption app (reading app) /platform </p>
better SERPs (basic logic that my friend who knows about it can guide me better than GOOG)
 

<br>    As the content overload is increasing, to keep up with all this content, the user has to acknowledge that, 
<br>(1) pocket zero is unreal unlike inbox zero, (2) be cautious of what you bring inside the system.

<br>
<br> This is what will control the incoming links, not curation. 
<br><p style="color:red;">index / bookmark | \[1\] [UIC] - home feed (what is now chronological).</p>
<br> curation is the problem of the century 
<br>/<a href="/beta.html">prioritize</a>/ for a better reading experience.

<br>	As end-consumers we consume a lot of diverse content across a number of platforms, but bookmarking is an inherent behaviour in users. 
<br> why we bookmark ? <a href="https://bytebaker.com/2010/10/05/why-bookmark/">link</a>

1) Bookmarking an item seems to be a very good way to remember stuff, even if you’re never going to look at the bookmark again. Just categorizing a bookmarking with tags, and thinking shortly about it, lets me remember most of the stuff I put in there.
2) Read Later buffer
3) Sharing. Bookmarking an item lets me share it with a lot of people, some of whom are friends, some I know from the web, and some I know not all. I’ve made handful of acquaintances with people with very much the same interests as me.

I tried to list out reasons I bookmarked
<br>	we have a various reasons why we want to those links (urls)	    
<br>3 buckets - unread, read, just-in-case 
<br>    (1) unread - seems interesting (just-in-case)(just open it in background and leave it to rot)
<br>	(2)	unread / half-read - Things you want to get back to, like for sure. 
<br>	(3) read - text that makes you say "nobody put it this way" (indexing) - for future reference \[read or started reading\] 

<br>prioritizing the unread-links in home-feed
<br>    (0) primary goal = sort/ filter/ prioritize feed. the list - curating yourself.

<br>opening new tabs(thought-trains) is the default behaviour.
<br>\[\[c0 clipboards &amp; interfaces\]\] -- browser
<br>    [1] It is not about reading the content of one page and going on to the next. 
<br>        It is about gathering the relevant data in the sea of nonsense, and leaving the tabs open, «in working  memory», until the gathered data 
<br>        // All the tabs that are open are not open because people forget to close them.
<br>       Instead, they act like living bookmarks. 
<br>       They are keys to thoughts and ideas, that you want to return to and continue thinking.
<br>
<br> Web pages that we visit and leave open are artifacts of externalized cognition; keys to thinking and remembering.
<br> The browser of today is a transitory space that brings us into a mental state, not just to a specific website destination. And we should design our browsers for this task.

<br>
<br>	\[1\] Most never go back to them. Links are dying everyday.
<br>	It seems you'll start dumping articles into read-later apps, just-in-case you need it later. And so far, pocket/ instapaper/ diigo and other major players only have a chronological feed of links saved [home-feed].

<br>	Users getting frustrated due to FOMO on the increasing load of articles which they never seem to complete, is totally unnecessary.

<br>The user not being able to keep up with his saving activity, and increasing load of articles which you never seem to complete, is totally unnecessary.

<p>	The Internet basically democratized a lot of things. It reduced the information assymmetry, but we're creating content at an unimaginable rate and it's hard ot chose what to consume. 
    Lists are the new search and the aggregation theory applies to zomato as well. Lol</p>
<br><a href"https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2016/1/31/lists-are-the-new-search">lists are the new search</a> 
<br>"all curation grows until it requires search and all search grows until it requires curation."
<br>It's hard to say, if we need more curation[3] or better search[2], but feeds are all lists.

<br>It's hard to know which ones are worthwhile before consuming it, but it suddenly hit me that at that point we bookmarked it, we have various reasons for why we bookmark ?


<br>    why we need to be working on this ?

<br>Reading apps are where a set of people go to first thing they open their phone. 
everyone came there for a reason and eventually they have to realize more reasons to come there.

<br>    Yes, if we succeed in gathering enough no. of users, we could grow from reading app into a discovery app as well.
<br>    but then again, it'll become yet another noisy feed. example - matter app
<br> so, stick to being a reading queue. 

<br> as network effects kick in, it'd start looking like all the people you give a fuck about will be there. I mean we joined every social-platform because our friends did, and then for the content. vice-versa is also true.

<br> for them, reasons to open the app is divided between utility and entertainment.
<br>	Your Status as a Service essay has made the rounds. You basically break social networks down in that article into three axes; utility, status, and then entertainment. And let's talk about the first two and what lessons that we think startup founders can learn from this. Is there an order of operations when you're building a product, when you're building a network? Are we looking primarily for utility? Are we looking for status? Both? I'd love to dive in there.


<br>		used social media before / nope, new to it all, 
<br>		claims to know (instant expert)/ exploring ideaologies
<br>		clubhouse made political conversations happen in their life
<p>	we're only having a discussion of the discussions happening in other social media platforms, which again are a refelction of the userbase of that platform.</p>
<p>	Discussions in twitter is where knowledge is rated. It is much more valuable than the comments on the article inside the blog. Ideas are the currency here.</p>
<br>It is a discussion we're having about a discussion and this happens for every thing. Anything could wrong.
<br>		We're all trying to bring consensus, when we can't actually.
<br>		We're only sharing things we come across,, but that consensus is only among those in that room.
<br>		we cannot bring consensus and we cannot control the discussion no matter what.
<br>		It's just meta.
<br>		we can only try to bring consensus.

<p>		Every user is assumed to be representing something, wherein we can't actually determine if he's geniune or has intentions(ulterior motives).</p>
<br>		Overlapping was so human, not bullying
<br>		It was an celebrity-mob interaction
<p>		please understand, you do not own the room, and you cannot control the discussion no matter what. it's just meta.</p>
it's okay to justify something based on how you see it in a nuanced way based on the instances in your life, but generalizing that is the problem. 
and the mob keeps generalizing 		



<br>



<br>I believe Instagram could unbundle into micro-blogging platform. The days of text-first social capital is long gone, but let me see if there is scope for it. text-first means captions get all the attention, not that mercedes you have in your picture or how cool you made the picture look like. Google Reader will be missed forever it seems. If not for Twitter and FB, you’d still be alive. Maybe you had to go, to make way for twitter and newer forms of social capital. Which now, clearly seems to be being in the ‘followed by speakers’ section of any chat room you wish to talk in clubhouse.
<br>	
<br> We all are status seeing monkeys. We keep judging things as higher in status and either become an admirer or envy it, and start thinking, how to perform better to reach higher status. [[Tim Urban - Wait but Why ?]]

<br>
<br>	Eugene Wei (33:20):
<br>	I certainly think there's something to the idea that humans are wired to be very, very conscious of status. And that it may have come from another time in mankind's history when your status within your small tribe or group was actually critical to your survival.

<br>	<a href="https://podcast.nfx.com/episodes/status-games-eugene-wei/transcript">Status Games with Eugene Wei (Product Lead at Amazon, Hulu, Erly, Flipboard, Oculus) and James Currier - NOVEMBER 10TH, 2020 | 49:27 | E55 </a>
<br>
<br>	EPISODE SUMMARY
<br>	Status can be a volatile, powerful driver of engagement. Status and one of its underlying mechanisms, scarcity must be considered by product designers in every category, as early on as possible. But it can also be a double-edged sword, as managing a network and the status dynamics within it is constantly recirculating, always shifting. For this reason, status that is more entertainment-based than utility-based can over time become precarious, as well as too restrictive for continued user growth. NFX partner James Currier sits down with Eugene Wei (Product Lead at Amazon, Hulu, Erly, Flipboard, Oculus) to draw from his original Status-as-a-Service article and expand to discuss status in entertainment, frameworks for emotional product design, video games as world leaders in defining scarcity, the future of virtual goods, and the underlying status games that drive us all -- in technology and in life.

<br> leaderboards
<br>    stats for gamification is not simply taking your product and adding points, levels, trophies, and badges. Well, researchers distinguished intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. With intrinsic motivation, we do things because we find them inherently satisfying and interesting. With extrinsic motivation, we do things to achieve rewards. And that’s the problem with rewards – they massively undermine intrinsic motivation. This is also why gamification does not work. When gamification appears to work, it is because the underlying experience is already a game.

<br> I actually think that people in the gaming world have more of an intuitive understanding of how important it is, moment to moment, to track your user's emotional valence. And that's partially because game designers sort of... Games are a continuous interactive experiences. 
<br>And if the user isn't feeling the right balance of challenged, plus motivated, plus rewarded in a game, they'll churn out. But I think that same principle can be applied to a lot of other products. How products take off a lot of it is in how they make you feel. If you watch any Apple keynote, going back to the Steve Jobs days, I think he is underrated for having this very intuitive understanding. That part of why people should buy Apple products or part of why they buy Apple products is that it makes them feel cool or it makes them feel hip, or it makes them feel creative. That applies to social networks just as much.

<br> utlimately, users are playing the game knowingly or unknowingly. 
<br>It seems like everyone are trying to control the algorithm to a certain extent.
<br>Users are optimizing their social/online presence for something. 
<br>for social-capital(clout / reputation) & creator monetisation(building an audience, managing a communities)






<br>    into the meta-verse (clubhouse x cities ft. @shl)

<br>
<br>	clout and social-capital (status as a service)
<br>    The Internt will accept your weirdness. Consumers are navigating away from mainstream markets and that is why they say, profitability will improve for the long tail / niches.

<br>	friction to publish (because we all are playing different games)

<br> [\] for content posted by your friends(people) or pages(publishers) and to connect with friends
<br> [\] for building an audience [every creator is a political party - cult x political party][[<a href="https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/">1,000 True Fans? Try 100 by Li Jin</a>]] or
<br> [\] for making friends on the internet and communities, for that social-connection part, or more like trying to find your tribe, as said in 'We're all tribes' - by seth godin.
<br> those who play well, can climb up the ladder. 
<br> Game being people judge you based on the content you create and reward you.

<br>we can also divide them btw consumers and creators (of content)  
<br> users can become creators, influencers, micro-famous and celebrities.
<br> rather these are all places to get fame, internet famous.


Clubhouse, clearly seems to increase the user's social-capital by him just be being in the ‘followed by speakers’ section of a chatroom.

<br>Clubhouse basically swallowed Twitter, when it comes to serendipity and building an audience.
<br>But I keep wondering how clubhouse is going to compete with platforms with scale like Twitter..,, most probably followed byzuck & co.
<br>Instagram followed by WhatsApp where local aunties might begossiping in a chat room.
<br>simulating an offline event, online and more specifically how networking happens online. Discord x Airmeet vs. clubhouse

<br> audio rooms truly seem like the future of bringing consensus. In clubhouse's case, contribution, moderation are the games, as far as I know.
<br> /clubhouse has all the attention/, but it only has one game to play - speaking. 
<br>
<br>	Now, it's like we're holding a mic in front of strangers (or) we feel like we have a mic in our hand 
<br>	we need to identify ourselves with something, pick a flag or get called half-baked.
<br>	we are being watched, and why I started recording was because I felt there was accountability or a    need to perform better in front of others
<br>	we are only aligning according to our beliefs, ideologies, faiths, stories and schools of thought.
