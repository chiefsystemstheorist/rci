the comments section in each article, accepts comments anonymously or asks the user to login. 
Publishers want users to login, to collect more data about them each time they visit the website.

<br>we can exploit our human nature of commenting on posts

<br> also, readers or consumers can be reading the article from anywhere, hence them commenting on articles could basically be done on any social-media platform (or) newsletter (or) anywhere else on the internet.
<br> due to this all these comments get siloed by default.
<br> what I propose is, if at all we succeed in gathering enough no. of users
<br>Discussions in twitter is where knowledge is rated. It is much more valuable than the comments on the article inside the blog. Ideas are the currency here.
<br>we could try to consolidate comments of articles here. Right now, comments are divided btw the site where it is posted, and other social media (it's a link that can be shared and spoken of anywhere)) and consolidating them would be a very big feat.

<br>So every time I unlock my phone now I'm given a choice of anything. I can choose what my diet of entertainment is. That actually makes all these forms of entertainment actually absolutely competitive with each other. In economics, we have this concept of substitutes. A product can substitute for another product. But I think in entertainment, what you have is actually a lot of forms of entertainment, while they might not be perfect for each other, they're close enough. They're good enough, right?
<br>Eugene Wei (12:18):
<br>I think a lot of companies that formerly looked at their competitive set as being companies that were directly in their vertical are missing out on the fact that they now compete with companies in a variety of verticals. And what that means is or what I often tell companies now is let's say your product doesn't really have much of a social layer. And you might say, hey, nobody in our industry has a social layer. That's not what movies are about. Movies are a passive form of entertainment. 



<br>summary -- 
<br>we think of hard politics as news, when it actually is entertainment.
<br>Eugene Wei (09:16):
<br>And so he said, "If you listen to a news report on something that happened in politics or something like that, is that hard news or is it entertainment?" And the mistake we make is often that we think something is news when it's actually just entertainment.

<br>A recent article in the Harvard Business Review puts a name to this new neurological phenomenon: Attention Deficit Trait. Basically, the terms ADD and ADHD are falling out of use because effectively the entire population fits the diagnostic criteria. It’s not a condition anymore, it’s a trait — the inherent and unavoidable experience of modern life characterized by “distractibility, inner frenzy, and impatience.”

<br>children might mark them as read, just to show off. The system might get gamed
<br>"as Mr. Munger says, people tend to game any system you put in place, and then they tend to rationalize that gaming until they believe they really are doing the right thing. I think it was Andy Grove who said that for every goal you put in front of someone, you should also put in place a counter-goal to restrict gaming of the first goal. 
<br> end of the day, who are they fooling ? Hence, only those who come for the utility

<br> Say, it grows into a single place for (or) go-to place for a lot of things.
<br> Yes, if we succeed in gathering enough no. of users, 

<br> But then again, it'll become yet another noisy feed. example - matter app
<br> So, stick to being a reading queue and focus on 1/2 things alone.






<br> for them, reasons to open the app is divided between utility and entertainment.
<br> And so far i argued curation ≠ filtration. And it is based on a utilitarian perspective.

<br>it is for utility or entertainment, based on what the user wants out of it
<br> status games basically evaluate PoW done by user's and rewards them
<br> Them using it is based on whatever they see it as, (utility or entertainment) and, what everyone else perceives it also has an influence on the user's perception of the app.

<br>entertainment-based / status axis

<br> utlimately, users are playing the game knowingly or unknowingly.

<br>As with cryptocurrency, if it were so easy, it wouldn't be worth anything.<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Value is tied to scarcity, and scarcity on social networks derives from proof of work. Status isn't worth much if there's no skill and effort required to mine it. It's not that a social network that makes it easy for lots of users to perform well can't be a useful one, but competition for relative status still motivates humans.</span> Recall our first tenet: humans are status-seeking monkeys. Status is a relative ladder. By definition, if everyone can achieve a certain type of status, it’s no status at all, it’s a participation trophy.
<br>
<br>Almost every social network of note had an early signature proof of work hurdle. For Facebook it was posting some witty text-based status update. For Instagram, it was posting an interesting square photo. For Vine, an entertaining 6-second video. For Twitter, it was writing an amusing bit of text of 140 characters or fewer. Pinterest? Pinning a compelling photo. You can likely derive the proof of work for other networks like Quora and Reddit and Twitch and so on. Successful social networks don't pose trick questions at the start, it’s usually clear what they want from you.

<br> indie writers and publishers can write anywhere, but they need to get paid.
<br> Medium, Substack, Twitter - all of them can add weights to content like 'curated by nameofuser' or 'written by', but these platforms still fail at showing relevant content. Tech should only show content that might be interesting or actually make sense to him or give him more context about something. hide irrelevant content even if the user follows that writer / publisher.
When we look at trends in consumption of online content and the “rules” holding us back, we can sum them up in one major bottleneck: We are still broadcasting journalism, while new digital content distribution platform players such as Facebook and Google are offering deeply personal experiences.
From Broadcasting to 1:1 Journalism








<br>publishing platforms - substack, medium
<br>discovery / curation apps and digital garden apps, in no particular order - { flipboard, feed, refind, matter app, nuzzel, deepstash, mymind, stash, sublist, are.na, odin }

<br> Readers(most) don't go to the website directly. They'd read it wherever they found it (feed, mail app) (or) save it for later. 
<br> they have dedicated apps to read articles and pdfs that they saved to them. but then all other sorts of text-first content can only be bookmarked, they cannot be brought to a more centralised information system. 
<br>
<br> They have to keep posting consistently and keep optimizing their presence according to the algorithm
<br>(1) social-media - to get picked up by the algorithm, to be shown in more no. of feeds (feeds of users who might find it relevant) and 
<br>(2) search - to get ranked in the 1st page. 
<br> But, Email is a direct relationship with the reader. Hence, Newsletters > having to get ranked in a feed (social-media platforms and SERPs). 
<br> 

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> all sorts of text content can be segmented based on where it is posted,
<br> (1) articles, pdfs - publishing platforms and discovery apps
<br> (2) (tweets, linkedin posts, reddit posts, quora answers & posts, facebook posts, captions in Instagram, Tumblr posts.etc) - social-media
<br>
<br> It can be written anywhere and reposted anywhere on the internet. But, there seems to a possibility that an app dedicated to reading for those with high attention spans, just for reading. 
<br>



<br>
<br>







<br>Now consider, reading articles as entertainment. It seems like we have certain expectations when we read something (utility), but we could also call it entertainment, as not all of us go great lengths to retain what we read. We don't have a clear metric to measure this sort of proof of work. 
<!--According to me, We only read to know just enough. maybe just for the sake of bragging rights, or to win arguments, or for n unknown reasons.
But what is clear is, since we read (consume) a lot of content, by default unless until we go back to it, we might not be able to understand it completely yet.-->











<!-- nobody put it this way-->
<br> It seems like users creating folders of links is them, creating scarcity in a way.

<br> Bookmark function in social networks, is for things the user wants to get his/her attention back to, is spread across a wide spectrum of apps. But they’re all silos of knowledge you gathered. 
<br> Aggregating all these silos and pooling it all into one place is a natural thought. But, it's not possible unless they give APIs.
<br>All of it are unique games - Reddit, Quora, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat - all these places have network effects in play. 


<br> social-layer is basically a status game on top of a utility I guess. And we're not going to stop using it all of a sudden. we're so used to it. 
<br>The problem is if all forms of entertainment are now effectively substitutes for each other, you actually don't compete with other movie studios. You actually compete with a game company that has built a really fun party game, social layer. And in the end user's mind, there's no distinction. So I think you compete with the best on every aspect, regardless of what industry they come from.
<br>James Currier (14:02):
<br>Absolutely. But Fortnite effectively is everyone's biggest competitor in entertainment, just as Netflix is a big competitor for Fortnite and vice versa.

<br> Yahoo was making a list of lists, but Google made search better.
<br>"All curation grows until it requires search. All search grows until it requires curation." — Benedict Evans (@benevans) December 18, 2015
<br>
<br> It makes sense back then, but now it's hard to say, if we need more curation[3] or better search[2] or a hybrid model, but remember this feeds are all lists, search is a filtered list
<br>
<br>"Hence, I always thought the most appealing part of Flipboard was the manually curated directory of sites to follow. It's a list of lists, but it isn't trying to encompass everything, and so, unlike Yahoo, it isn't unmanageably big. But that just relocates the problem - what if you want a list that isn't on the list of lists? If you wanted to find 5 new sites to read about a topic you care about - ice-climbing, or vintage furniture, or experimental electronic music, or children's picture books - where would you find it? Can you create a platform for all those lists without turning into Yahoo? And it's worth remembering that Google hasn't actually solved this either - it might give you one blog post, but not a list of 20 sites to try. (Indeed, one could suggest that blogs themselves break Google in some sense - you're looking for a stream, but Google can only give you the post.)"

<br>
<br> As the number of pages on the Internet kept increasing, search made sense. 
<br> When we introduce scarcity, there'll be chance to build irreplaceable business on top of the platform/aggregator.
