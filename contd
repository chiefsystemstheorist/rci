<br> 
<br> Say, it grows into a single place for (or) go-to place for a lot of things.
<br> Yes, if we succeed in gathering enough no. of users, 
<br> We could grow from reading app into a discovery app as well. (actually experiment the shit outta them) 
<br> But then again, it'll become yet another noisy feed. example - matter app
<br> So, stick to being a reading queue and focus on 1/2 things alone.

<br>we can exploit our human nature of commenting on posts
<br> also, readers or consumers can be reading the article from anywhere, hence them commenting on articles could basically be done on any social-media platform (or) newsletter (or) anywhere else on the internet.
<br> due to this all these comments get siloed by default.
<br> what I propose is, if at all we succeed in gathering enough no. of users
<br>Discussions in twitter is where knowledge is rated. It is much more valuable than the comments on the article inside the blog. Ideas are the currency here.
<br>we could try to consolidate comments of articles here. Right now, comments are divided btw the site where it is posted, and other social media (it's a link that can be shared and spoken of anywhere)) and consolidating them would be a very big feat.

<br>when building a entertainment-based product, there are more substitutes 


 
<br>Eugene Wei (11:32):
<br>So every time I unlock my phone now I'm given a choice of anything. I can choose what my diet of entertainment is. That actually makes all these forms of entertainment actually absolutely competitive with each other. In economics, we have this concept of substitutes. A product can substitute for another product. But I think in entertainment, what you have is actually a lot of forms of entertainment, while they might not be perfect for each other, they're close enough. They're good enough, right?

<br>Eugene Wei (12:18):
<br>I think a lot of companies that formerly looked at their competitive set as being companies that were directly in their vertical are missing out on the fact that they now compete with companies in a variety of verticals. And what that means is or what I often tell companies now is let's say your product doesn't really have much of a social layer. And you might say, hey, nobody in our industry has a social layer. That's not what movies are about. Movies are a passive form of entertainment. 



<br>summary -- 
<br>we think of hard politics as news, when it actually is entertainment.
<br>Eugene Wei (09:16):
<br>And so he said, "If you listen to a news report on something that happened in politics or something like that, is that hard news or is it entertainment?" And the mistake we make is often that we think something is news when it's actually just entertainment.

<br>All I'm saying is, by helping them with reading and retaining more, we become their default reading app. 
<br>And this is how I suppose, we could make it a game. (all

<br>Eugene Wei (02:32):
<br> I actually think that people in the gaming world have more of an intuitive understanding of how important it is, moment to moment, to track your user's emotional valence. And that's partially because game designers sort of... Games are a continuous interactive experiences. 
<br>And if the user isn't feeling the right balance of challenged, plus motivated, plus rewarded in a game, they'll churn out. But I think that same principle can be applied to a lot of other products. How products take off a lot of it is in how they make you feel. If you watch any Apple keynote, going back to the Steve Jobs days, I think he is underrated for having this very intuitive understanding. That part of why people should buy Apple products or part of why they buy Apple products is that it makes them feel cool or it makes them feel hip, or it makes them feel creative. That applies to social networks just as much.

<br> leaderboards   

<br>    stats for gamification is not simply taking your product and adding points, levels, trophies, and badges. Well, researchers distinguished intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. With intrinsic motivation, we do things because we find them inherently satisfying and interesting. With extrinsic motivation, we do things to achieve rewards. And that’s the problem with rewards – they massively undermine intrinsic motivation. This is also why gamification does not work. When gamification appears to work, it is because the underlying experience is already a game.

<br>/3 What is the simplest behaviour in anticipation of reward ?
<br> I'll give 2 answers, in terms of clout.
<br>(1) the power-user is there for our prioritization first. He really wants to reach pocket zero (zero unread articles) and doesn't  give a damn about if he gets any clout out of the nerd he is. 
<br>(2) average users now with leaderboards have this incentive to read, as them reading could be visualised into clout as in github's 365-day coding streak and shades based on certain proof of work.

<br>A recent article in the Harvard Business Review puts a name to this new neurological phenomenon: Attention Deficit Trait. Basically, the terms ADD and ADHD are falling out of use because effectively the entire population fits the diagnostic criteria. It’s not a condition anymore, it’s a trait — the inherent and unavoidable experience of modern life characterized by “distractibility, inner frenzy, and impatience.”

<br> a place to learn anything, since search might be better here.















'Articles' can be broken down based on shelf life and word count.
my assumption is only those with shelf life greater than a day to a week, get bookmarked.

Now consider, reading articles as entertainment. It seems like we have certain expectations when we read something (utility). According to me,   
We only read to know just enough. maybe just for the sake of bragging rights, or to win arguments, or for n unknown reasons.
But what is clear is, since we read (sonsume) a lot of content, by default unless until we go back to it, we might not be able to understand it completely yet.






<br>James Currier (14:17):
<br>Right. And ultimately, I think we've heard this before, but it's competing for our attention. It's competing for our time. And ultimately there's only a certain number of hours in the day. And so as we look at a world of the internet or of Chinese manufacturing with sort of an infinitude of anything you might want, as we move to the infinity, then really we're looking for scarcity. And scarcity is created by the number of hours in the day, for instance.

<br>James Currier (16:40):
<br>As we look at the gamification of everything, we realized that the world had been gamified before with U.S. News & World Report publishing the list of colleges in 1981, which has set off this mad, crazy game about getting into college and achieving status and that sort of thing. They created this scarcity. Who's number one? Who's in the top 10? Who's in the top 50? What other ways are you seeing people create scarcity that then produces energy for people or produces businesses?
<br>Eugene Wei (17:05):
<br>Yeah. That's a great question. I love your U.S. News & World Report example. A lot of, I feel like, the tension from the last generation of media to this new world of more distributed network media is just that the gatekeepers that used to define scarcity have lost a lot of power in the modern world. <font color="black">And ultimately, if you're allowed to define scarcity on any axis, that is a form of power.</font> So if we were to look at networked apps and things like that, you brought up lists and ranks lists. That's certainly going to continue to be a really important way in which people define scarcity. And that's like working its way through every sort of vertical in the world. I also think there is just like, if we were to look at video games, that's just a metaphor for a lot of us and you study the video game world, and you see that they've become really the leaders in the world at figuring out how to define forms of scarcity.

<br> It seems like users creating folders of links is them basically creating scarcity.

<br> Bookmark function in social networks, is for things the user wants to get his/her attention back to, is spread across a wide spectrum of apps. But they’re all silos of knowledge you gathered. 
<br> Aggregating all these silos and pooling it all into one place is a natural thought. But, it's not possible unless they give APIs.
<br>All of it are unique games - Reddit, Quora, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat - all these places have network effects in play. 

<br> We need to realize that the user is actually submitting links to the reading app, but then it has remained chronological all this while. 
<br> Indexing is being done by the reader himself, as he is basically weaving his demonstrable understanding, by naming the space properly during consumption itself, making collections of links about topics he knows about in depth. This is just my observation.

<br> People submit their sites to google for it to crawl, index and serve it to end-users.
<br> [1] On the other hand, bookmarks are basically the internet I set aside for later consumption and [2] and power-users foldering bookmarks seems like users are creating an index for their bookmarks.








<br> At the time of bookmarking itself we can ask him for inputs ? we might get to know how important it is to him.
<br> When the user gives contextual inputs like for the author, for the blog, for the headline, all three.,, or something similar, that tries to capture as much info as possible for the algorithm to decide how important it is to the user,, it becomes easier to prioritize.
<br> When saving it, we try to put it under a folder and add appropriate hashtags for us to be able to access it easily the next time around. (power-user)

<br>better SERPs (basic logic that my friend who knows about it can guide me better than GOOG). Searching those keywords inside the reading lists of people you follow here would give better results than google, but the user is still in an echochamber.

assuming the users of reading apps wouldn't have save generic content, it could be said that searching inside bookmarks would by default give better results than google. / Think of the search bar in news.ycombinator.com/
<br> And, the use of query-modifiers is enough validation that, Google is not serving quality content. It has more generic SEO-centric content in it SERPs.

<br>
<br> One interesting pattern I found among readers in twitter is that, quality pieces of content they come across in their feeds cannot be found in google search results, by a noob who is trying to learn that topic. 
<br> Only because they follow certain people on twitter, they’re able to access such content and google cannot give you that, as it unnecessarily searches through a lot of noise and that too only based on the combinations of keywords you enter (this is a skill in itself). Maybe I'm not articulating it properly. It seems it's like Google is running a contest to decide who should be shown in the 1st page of SERPs (have temporary ownership over certain keyword 
combinations) in Google's state-of-the-art Search Engine.
