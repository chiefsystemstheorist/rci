<br>-- observed-behaviours --

<br>    [1] leave 100s of tabs open for days/ weeks.
<br>    [2] hoard articles and never get back to them.
<br>	Users are frustrated, they cannot keep up with their hoarding habit.

<br>    Trying to understand the origins of the hundreds of links unread.
<br>    We consume content through (newsletters and social-networks) and (through browsing)

<br>    It seems as if we bookmark them and read them as we come across as it in social-media platforms, but in reality, some users religiously follow content from certain people and publishers through their feeds(will have post notifs on) and newsletters. 
<br>    They don't go to the website directly, they get their content through social-media platforms and newsletters.

<br>    From the publisher's PoV, (publisher's = individual creators (people) and pages), they have to keep posting (that too consistently) according to the algorithm of that aggregator to get picked up by the algorithm, to be shown in more no. of feeds (feeds of users who might find it relevant). Also, in social-media platforms, publisher's posts might get lost in the feed. [[n1]]
<br>    Email is a direct relationship with the reader. Hence, Newsletters > having to get ranked in a feed (social-media platforms and SERPs). 
<br>    still, when it comes to the overload, newsletters are just one channel. You may get your links from anywhere, but there are some people who use reading apps, the final destination where they consume the content they saved for later.
<br>    Yes, if we succeed in gathering enough no. of users, we could grow from reading app into a discovery app as well.
<br>    but then again, it'll become yet another noisy feed. example - matter app
<br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A Substack of carefully selected links and analysis is helpful, but not if everyone is pushing one.<br><br>Curation is content in itself, masked as a service.</p>&mdash; Matt Klein (@KleinKleinKlein) <a href="https://twitter.com/KleinKleinKlein/status/1340751191572135941?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 20, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New idea from a blog post that has been on my mind a lot the last month: that info overload is not due to filter failure, but filter success. Everything is so good now (or at least alluring) it’s hard to turn away. And having better filters only makes that problem worse</p>&mdash; Tiago Forte (@fortelabs) <a href="https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1075294724330831872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<br> so, stick to being a reading queue. 

<br>    People submit their sites to google for it to crawl, index and serve it to end-users.
<br>    On the other hand, bookmarks are basically the internet I set aside for later consumption and power-users foldering bookmarks seems like users are creating an index for their bookmarks.
<br>    The use of query-modifiers is enough validation that, Google is not serving quality content. It has more generic SEO-centric content in it SERPs.
<br>    better SERPs (basic logic that my friend who knows about it can guide me better than GOOG)
<br>    search in consumption app (reading app) /platform 
<br> 
<br>	<!--after saving-->
<!-- solving for the overload -->

<br>    As the content overload is increasing, to keep up with all this content, the user has to acknowledge that, 
<br>    (1) pocket zero is unreal unlike inbox zero, (2) be cautious you bring inside the system.

<br>	But Pocket is a dump.
<br>	\[1\] Most never go back to them. Links are dying everyday.
<br>	It seems you'll start dumping articles into read-later apps, just-in-case you need it later. And so far, pocket/ instapaper/ diigo and other major players only have a chronological feed of links saved [home-feed].

<br>	Users getting frustrated due to FOMO on the increasing load of articles which they never seem to complete, is totally unnecessary.
<br>	// tweets as validation
<br>The user not being able to keep up with his saving activity, and increasing load of articles which you never seem to complete, is totally unnecessary. 
<br>oh, you're getting frustrated, you can't keep up with the list, FOMO huh ?! 
<br>Fear not for all those instances you saved just-in-case won't go to the grave. 
<br>/archived, but searchable/

<br><< bonus-points >>
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>[2] search - what clarity is, is different to different people, but for me it is being able to retrieve stuff (cognitive spaces/ mental-sessions, or it could be articles/ tweets) instantly on command.



<br>and social-media platforms can actually bring consensus (being on the same page - alignment)  //(leaderboards)
<br>In a lot of ways, we've digitized trust and we need to hold them accountable to a certain extent.
<br>aggregators can be publishers
<!--page2 platform & leaderboards-->
<br>/<a href="/serps.html">consensus</a>/


    <br> I say we need to introduce scarcity (Eugene Wei +100). 
    <br>(1) A case for subscription only supply of scarcity. 
    <br>(2) At the same time, Ads are good, as satire cannot be paid for. confusing Ikr. But I get it, so moving on.
    
    there are 2 incentives 
    incentive for publishers to become irreplaceble here than elsewhere, as we're really serious about improving serps 
    incentive to bookmark here, as this will also make search better in the longer run

<br>Previously, 


Indexing is being done by the reader himself, as he is basically weaving his demonstrable understanding, by naming the space properly during consumption itself (write one-liner), making collections of links about topics he knows in depth.
I mean them foldering a post a giving it a name itself could be considered as indexing.

<br>
<br>	content is consumed wherever it is posted, but long form content like articles and newsletters are mostly saved for later.




    <br>
    <br> a 
    <br>[1] newsletters
    <br>[2] feeds - twitter, linkedin, reddit, tumblr, instagram, facebook.etc
    <br>[3] browser from Goggle's SERP & backlinks 
    <br>[4] 
    <br>
    <br>- Matter Reader - 
    <br>(a) imports quote retweeted links by people you follow in twitter, just like refind (in refind, it imports links of those people you follow in refind) 
    <br>(b) imports posts from blogs of people you follow in twitter and their newsletter posts 
    <br>(c) can follow blogs & newsletters, in matter itself.
<br>    There are signs of people who want a place specifically dedicated for reading. Discovery should come much later (for those with high attention spans)

    

<br>	They have this guilt they're not able to finish things they save and that pocket / instapaper are dumps.

    Reading apps are where a set of people go to first thing they open their phone. 
    everyone came there for a reason and eventually they have to realize more reasons to come there.
    they get in through notifications (internal-triggers) and gradually they open it first thing they open the device. [[CJ]]
    as network effects kick in, it'd start looking like all the people you give a fuck about will be there. I mean we joined every social-platform because our friends did, and then for the content. vice-versa is also true.
    
    we all are status seeing monkeys. we keep judging things as higher in status and either become an admirer or envy it, and start thinking, how to perform better to reach higher status. \[\[nerds - creator monetization = HIGHER STATUS (social capital)\]\] v. \[\[noobs - potential paying user personas\]\]

stats for gamification is not simply taking your product and adding points, levels, trophies, and badges. Well, researchers distinguished intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. With intrinsic motivation, we do things because we find them inherently satisfying and interesting. With extrinsic motivation, we do things to achieve rewards. And that’s the problem with rewards – they massively undermine intrinsic motivation. This is also why gamification does not work. When gamification appears to work, it is because the underlying experience is already a game.


We have to make them migrate from Europe to America. Make them identify themselves as part of the community or cult. — [musical.ly](http://musical.ly/) CEO youtube transcripts
