<p>I'm Manu. 22. I don't have an excellent academic track record and I haven't built anything so far. I finally I'm able to articulate my thoughts into writing [you can always bridge your thoughts]
so, why am I writing. (a) to think better. (b) The byproduct of the pursuit of a great product idea, is the content or more like copy, you could use for distribution, to build conviction, a beta-list.</p>

<br>[1] leave 100s of tabs open for days/ weeks - <a href="https://www.notion.so/manublj/a8ed8f719e1d4cb683829e789c2c5245?v=8b6d0fe10d884145b91b19c818b91c86">tweets as validation</a>
[[<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16671957">comments from hackernews</a>]]
[[<a href="https://rybakov.com/blog/open_tabs_are_cognitive_spaces">Tabs are cognitive spaces</a>]]
<br>opening new tabs(thought-trains) is the default behaviour.
<br>Open Tabs = cognitive spaces = thought-trains. \[\[c0 clipboards & interfaces\]\] -- browser
<br>    [1] It is not about reading the content of one page and going on to the next. 
	    It is about gathering the relevant data in the sea of nonsense, and leaving the tabs open, «in working  memory», until the gathered data 
        // All the tabs that are open are not open because people forget to close them.
	   Instead, they act like living bookmarks. 
	   They are keys to thoughts and ideas, that you want to return to and continue thinking.
<br>
<br>Our brain is a constant stream of thoughts and we keep jumping from train to train, from tab to tab, travelling through cognitive spaces, without losing enthusiasm, without closing it so it can rot there for the next 3 months or so, trying to find the answer to something.

<br>While reading about a topic / doing research, The user starts with one tab and as he reads the article, we tend to click on 'open in new tab' often, He'll click on 'Open in new tab often', switching tabs and , in the end there will be some 100-150 or more open tabs.

<br>for example -
<br>this is  how I google - I started with 'financial inclusion in India', 'RBI guidelines for NBFCs, Pre-paid Instruments. etc' and ended up in 'mobile money in Nigeria'.
<br>0 to 59 tabs in 3 windows and 2 browsera in less than an hour.somewhere in one of those 'open in new tab' clicks user will br opening links which might be a wolly new topic from what He/She was reading previously
<br>In the end, no. of threads created would be equal to the no. of times you went down a new rabbit hole.
<br>In retrospect, You might end up with hundreds of links you found from different platforms on the internet.
<br>
<br> [[flow of information in the funnel]]
<br>Trying to understand the origins of the hundreds of links unread, lying dead in our Pocket/ Instapaper and all the other links that got bookmarked, but didn't make it to the read-later app.
<br>- /surfing/	All those links you saved, come from one of these places.
<br>[a] // DISCOVERY---|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>(1) newsletters	
<br>(2) feeds - twitter, linkedin, reddit, tumblr, instagram, facebook.etc
<br>(3) browser /surfing/ (power users - research driven education)
<br> 3.1|-----from Goggle's SERP
<br> 3.2|-----through backlinks t1 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>This is how the list is created [[DISCOVERY]].
<br>I see a lot of people following to make sure they get the most out of whatever they read example
<br>a tweet -->b "@readwise save thread", and readwise will save that tweet -->c enter, spaced repetition.-->d note-taking tools integrating with spaced repetition to import excerpts and highlights. (example - readwise to roam-research.inc)
<br>(b) Pocket / Instapaper
<br>(c) readwise [[controlling exposure]]
<br>(d) roam-research.inc [[video-game -- wordprocessor]]
<br>5 imaginary - back to platforms as a creator/ independent publisher.
<br> 
<br>As long as I have foldered/tagged properly, I can easily find it when needed and maybe re-read it and try to, retain most of what I read. I see there is nothing wrong in saving most of the things I come across.
<br> But, it becomes really hard to keep track of  all the living bookmarks, just like how we keep losing track of what we were thinking and how we got there.
<br> The browser is capable of handling 100s of tabs in multiple windows, but isn't it a clusterfuck ?! current solutions seem like a joke.	
<br>Only if I can cache it properly in a structured way, it’ll be possible for me to retain better.
<br>Hard to make a satisfying graph of uniquely shaped internal representation ,which are assimilated just-in-case over time, but when connected/ foldered/ labelled properly, would be a wealth of knowledge, once it hits critical mass.
<br>To make sense out of the all the chaos, you would start caregorizing or foldering the knowledge you gathered (external cognition).

<br>index / bookmark
<br>\[1\] [UIC] - home feed (what is now chronological) [realizing that users curate their home-feed (in Pocket), not the algorithm]<a href="/beta.html">linkfest</a> knowing what to read and what to skip. 
<br>prioritize`
<br>we need to acknowledge the fact that, we're the ones in-charge of regualting of our feed. 
users actually control who they follow, who follows them (and how they influence the people who follow them), things they wouldn't want to miss out (FOMO),.. ultimately the quality of the feed.
<br>feed cleansing - unfollowing regularly leads to a quality feed and normalizing that makes people more responsible and accountable.
<br>It's just that social-platforms don't yet realize that using these controls itself will help reduce this overwhelming feeling that we're drowing in the content overload.
<p>	The Internet basically democratized a lot of things. It reduced the information assymmetry, but we're already creating content at an unimaginable rate.</p>
<br> the Internet is fukked. (signal v. noise)
<br> lists are the new search. (leaderboards). We've invested in lists in twitter, likewise this behvaiour could be applied across platforms to prioritize your content queue.
<br> curation is the problem of the century
<br> [2] curation (recommendations) 	
<br> explore feed - a ton of unrelated articles. this feed is made up of everything that I'm interested in.
<br> // [curation = creation][synthesis & compilations][produsable][t10]
<br> [ ]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br> platforms || aggregators of attention (content distributors) - aggregation theory (it's kind of like a 20 mark question, but once you understand it'll blow your ind)
<br> diff. btw platforms and aggregators ? 
<br> I say we need to introduce scarcity (Eugene Wei +100). (1) A case for subscription only supply of scarcity. (2) At the same time, Ads are good, as satire cannot be paid for. confusing Ikr. But I get it, so moving on.

<br> << bonus-points >>
<br> 2nd order consequences of me trying to solve for prioritizing the [home-feed]    
<br> [1] search - what clarity is, is different to different people, but for me it is being able to retrieve stuff (cognitive spaces/ mental-sessions, or it could be articles/ tweets) instantly on command.
<br> better SERPs (basic logic that my friend who knows about it can guide me better than GOOG)
<br> social-networks can actually bring consensus (being on the same page - alignment)
<br> In a lot of ways, we've digitized trust and we want to hold them accountable to a certain extent.
<br> aggregators can be publishers 


    

<br> I actually think that people in the gaming world have more of an intuitive understanding of how important it is, moment to moment, to track your user's emotional valence. And that's partially because game designers sort of... Games are a continuous interactive experiences. 
<br>And if the user isn't feeling the right balance of challenged, plus motivated, plus rewarded in a game, they'll churn out. But I think that same principle can be applied to a lot of other products. How products take off a lot of it is in how they make you feel. If you watch any Apple keynote, going back to the Steve Jobs days, I think he is underrated for having this very intuitive understanding. That part of why people should buy Apple products or part of why they buy Apple products is that it makes them feel cool or it makes them feel hip, or it makes them feel creative. That applies to social networks just as much.

<br> Game meaning people judge you based on the content you create.
<br> reasons to open the app is divided between utility and entertainment.
<br> [\] for content posted by your friends(people) or pages(publishers) and to connect with friends

<br> [\] for building an audience [every creator is a political party - cult x political party][[<a href="https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/">1,000 True Fans? Try 100 by Li Jin</a>]] or
<br> [\] for making friends on the internet and communities, for that social-connection part, or more like trying to find your tribe, as said in 'We're all tribes' - by seth godin.
<br> but utlimately, users are playing the game knowingly or unknowingly. Users are optimizing their social/online presence for something. 
<br> those who play well, can climb up the ladder. 
product adoption lifecycle - [celebrity[micro-famous[user]]]
It seems like everyone are trying to control the algorithm to a certain extent.
for social-capital & creator monetisation    
<br>
<br>	clout and social-capital (status as a service)
<br>    The Internt will accept your weirdness. Consumers are navigating away from mainstream markets and that is why they say, profitability will improve for the long tail / niches. 
<br>	scaling intimacy
<br>	friction to publish
<br>    into the meta-verse (clubhouse x cities ft. @shl)
<br> audio rooms truly seem like the future of bringing consensus. In clubhouse's case, contribution, moderation are the games, as far as I know.
<br> /clubhouse has all the attention/, but it only has one game to play - speaking. 
<br>	Now, it's like we're holding a mic in front of strangers (or) we feel like we have a mic in our hand 
<br>	we need to identify ourselves with something, pick a flag or get called half-baked.
<br>	we are being watched, and why I started recording was because I felt there was accountability or a    need to perform better in front of others
<br>	we are only aligning according to our beliefs, ideologies, faiths, stories and schools of thought.
<br>	users can become creators, influencers, micro-famous and celebrities.
<br>	rather these are all places to get fame, internet famous.
<br> this is my bet - and just like everyone else, we need to create scarcity. we could try to simulate a scarcity of oppurtunities.
<br> make it look like there's an abundance of oppurtunities, unlike the scarcity of it's supply in the real-world.
