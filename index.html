<p>I'm Manu. 22. I don't have an excellent academic track record and I haven't built anything so far. I finally I'm able to articulate my thoughts into writing [you can always bridge your thoughts]
so, why am I writing. (a) to think better. (b) The byproduct of the pursuit of a great product idea, is the content or more like copy, you could use for distribution, to build conviction, a beta-list.</p>

<br>[1] leave 100s of tabs open for days/ weeks - <a href="https://www.notion.so/manublj/a8ed8f719e1d4cb683829e789c2c5245?v=8b6d0fe10d884145b91b19c818b91c86">tweets as validation</a>
[[<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16671957">comments from hackernews</a>]]
[[<a href="https://rybakov.com/blog/open_tabs_are_cognitive_spaces">Tabs are cognitive spaces</a>]]
<br>opening new tabs(thought-trains) is the default behaviour.
<br>Open Tabs = cognitive spaces = thought-trains. \[\[c0 clipboards & interfaces\]\] -- browser
<br>    [1] It is not about reading the content of one page and going on to the next. 
	    It is about gathering the relevant data in the sea of nonsense, and leaving the tabs open, «in working  memory», until the gathered data 
        // All the tabs that are open are not open because people forget to close them.
	   Instead, they act like living bookmarks. 
	   They are keys to thoughts and ideas, that you want to return to and continue thinking.
<br>
<br>Our brain is a constant stream of thoughts and we keep jumping from train to train, from tab to tab, travelling through cognitive spaces, without losing enthusiasm, without closing it so it can rot there for the next 3 months or so, trying to find the answer to something.

<br>While reading about a topic / doing research, The user starts with one tab and as he reads the article, we tend to click on 'open in new tab' often, He'll click on 'Open in new tab often', switching tabs and , in the end there will be some 100-150 or more open tabs.

<br>for example -
<br>this is  how I google - I started with 'financial inclusion in India', 'RBI guidelines for NBFCs, Pre-paid Instruments. etc' and ended up in 'mobile money in Nigeria'.
<br>0 to 59 tabs in 3 windows and 2 browsera in less than an hour.somewhere in one of those 'open in new tab' clicks user will br opening links which might be a wolly new topic from what He/She was reading previously.
<br>In the end, no. of threads created would be equal to the no. of times you went down a new rabbit hole.
<br>In retrospect, You might end up with hundreds of links you found from different platforms on the internet.
<br>
<br> [[flow of information in the funnel]]
<br>Trying to understand the origins of the hundreds of links unread, lying dead in our Pocket/ Instapaper and all the other links that got bookmarked, but didn't make it to the read-later app.
<br>- /surfing/	All those links you saved, come from one of these places.
<br>[a] // DISCOVERY---|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>(1) newsletters	
<br>(2) feeds - twitter, linkedin, reddit, tumblr, instagram, facebook.etc
<br>(3) browser /surfing/ (power users - research driven education)
<br> 3.1|-----from Goggle's SERP
<br> 3.2|-----through backlinks t1 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>This is how the list is created [[DISCOVERY]].
<br>I see a lot of people following to make sure they get the most out of whatever they read example
<br>a tweet -->b "@readwise save thread", and readwise will save that tweet -->c enter, spaced repetition.-->d note-taking tools integrating with spaced repetition to import excerpts and highlights. (example - readwise to roam-research.inc)
<br>(b) Pocket / Instapaper
<br>(c) readwise [[controlling exposure]]
<br>(d) roam-research.inc [[video-game -- wordprocessor]]
<br>5 imaginary - back to platforms as a creator/ independent publisher.
<br> 
<br>As long as I have foldered/tagged properly, I can easily find it when needed and maybe re-read it and try to, retain most of what I read. I see there is nothing wrong in saving most of the things I come across.
<br> But, it becomes really hard to keep track of  all the living bookmarks, just like how we keep losing track of what we were thinking and how we got there.
<br> The browser is capable of handling 100s of tabs in multiple windows, but isn't it a clusterfuck ?! current solutions seem like a joke.	
<br>Only if I can cache it properly in a structured way, it’ll be possible for me to retain better.
<br>Hard to make a satisfying graph of uniquely shaped internal representation ,which are assimilated just-in-case over time, but when connected/ foldered/ labelled properly, would be a wealth of knowledge, once it hits critical mass.
<br>To make sense out of the all the chaos, you would start caregorizing or foldering the knowledge you gathered (external cognition).
<br>
<br>index / bookmark
<br>\[1\] [UIC] - home feed (what is now chronological) [realizing that users curate their home-feed (in Pocket), not the algorithm]<a href="/beta.html">linkfest</a> knowing what to read and what to skip. 

prioritize
    
    
<br> the Internet is fukked. (signal v. noise) 

<br> 2nd order consequences of me trying to solve for prioritizing the [home-feed]    
<br> [1] search - what clarity is, is different to different people, but for me it is being able to retrieve stuff (cognitive spaces/ mental-sessions, or it could be articles/ tweets) instantly on command.
<br> better SERPs
<br> [2] curation 
<br> \[\] recommendation - [explore feed] [curation = creation][synthesis & compilations][produsable][t10]	
<br>explore feed - a ton of unrelated articles. this feed is made up of everything that I'm interested in.
<br> lists are the new search. (leaderboards)
<br> curation is the problem of the century
If we succeed in better 

<br> aggregators are publishers
<br> bringing consensus 



Every piece of incoming link is 
<br> I need the reader app to queue it for me. 


caching content happens as we browse the Internet, it also includes us scrolling through aggregators like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook.  
As end-consumers we consume a lot of diverse content across a number of platforms
To a significant percent of users, instagram is the internet they know, or twitter is the internet they know, reddit and google is their internet, it depends from person to person. 
Hence indexing just webpages will not cut it, all file formats of content across platforms all are part of the Internet. 
articles are just one of the [file-formats](https://www.notion.so/file-formats-8e6aa86afe4349ec91a40af035a52418)
The user not being able to keep up with his saving activity, frustrated due to FOMO on the most recent tweets of all those you follow and increasing load of articles which you never seem to complete, is totally unnecessary.

what would happen if we tried to index it all, all the content on the Internet under topics.
because users are basically submitting links
\[1\] saving is validation
I understood users themselves are indexing by saving it somewhere and they feel guilty for not going back to it. FOMO.
    
Once you add signals or index it properly, it all comes into perspective and it’s gonna be lit innit. avlodhaan da.
all content posted is evaluated by us wherein we assign it values like like, share, subscribe, save, comment - based on how much we resonate with it. 
some people go on to repost it, retweet it, post as story/ status, and this behaviour is seen in people who want to be identified as something or to make people aware or clearly for dopamine.

    
we need to acknowledge the fact that, we're the ones in-charge of regualting of our feed. users actually control who they follow, how they influence the people who follow them, things they wouldn't want to miss out,.. ultimately the quality of the feed.
<br>It's just that social-platforms did not emphasis it's importance.
<br>feed cleansing - unfollowing regularly leads to a quality feed and normalizing that makes people more responsible and accountable.
<br>(1) home-feed
<br>(2) post notification ON
<br>(3) lists based on topics of interest
<br>(3) explore-feed

        <br> I actually think that people in the gaming world have more of an intuitive understanding of how important it is, moment to moment, to track your user's emotional valence. And that's partially because game designers sort of... Games are a continuous interactive experiences. 
        <br>And if the user isn't feeling the right balance of challenged, plus motivated, plus rewarded in a game, they'll churn out. But I think that same principle can be applied to a lot of other products. How products take off a lot of it is in how they make you feel. If you watch any Apple keynote, going back to the Steve Jobs days, I think he is underrated for having this very intuitive understanding. That part of why people should buy Apple products or part of why they buy Apple products is that it makes them feel cool or it makes them feel hip, or it makes them feel creative. That applies to social networks just as much.

<br>			friction to publish
<br>			making friends on the internet and communities

<br>		we are being watched, and why I started recording was because I felt there was accountability or a    need to perform better in front of others
<br>		reasons to open the app is divided between utility and entertainment.
<br>		satire cannot be paid for
<br>		rather these are all places to get fame, internet famous.
<br>		users can become creators, influencers, micro-famous and celebrities.
<br>		we are only aligning according to our beliefs, ideologies, faiths, stories and schools of thought.


cult meets a political party - 

<br>// designing a product is keeping 5000 things in your brain -- these concepts -- and fitting them all together and kind of continuing to push to fit them together in new and different ways to get what you want.
