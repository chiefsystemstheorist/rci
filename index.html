    <p>	The Internet basically democratized a lot of things. It reduced the information assymmetry, but we're creating content at an unimaginable rate and it's hard ot chose what to consume. 
        Lists are the new search and the aggregation theory applies to zomato as well. Lol</p>
    <br><a href"https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2016/1/31/lists-are-the-new-search">lists are the new search</a> 
    <br>"all curation grows until it requires search and all search grows until it requires curation."
    <br>It's hard to say, if we need more curation[3] or better search[2], but feeds are all lists.

    <br>    why we need to be working on this ?
    
    <br>It's hard to know which ones are worthwhile before consuming it, but it suddenly hit me that at that point we bookmarked it, we have various reasons for why we bookmark ?

    <br> audio rooms truly seem like the future of bringing consensus. In clubhouse's case, contribution, moderation are the games, as far as I know.
    <br> /clubhouse has all the attention/, but it only has one game to play - speaking. 
    <br>
    <br>	Now, it's like we're holding a mic in front of strangers (or) we feel like we have a mic in our hand 
    <br>	we need to identify ourselves with something, pick a flag or get called half-baked.
    <br>	we are being watched, and why I started recording was because I felt there was accountability or a    need to perform better in front of others
    <br>	we are only aligning according to our beliefs, ideologies, faiths, stories and schools of thought.

<br>	The days of text-first social capital is long gone, but let me see if there is scope for it. text-first means captions get all the attention, not that mercedes you have in your picture or how cool you made the picture look like. Google Reader you’ll forever be missed. We still mourn for you. If not for Twitter and FB, you’d still be alive. Maybe you had go, to make way for twitter and newer forms of social capital. Which now, clearly seems to be being in the ‘followed by speakers’ section of any chat room you wish to talk IN DA Clubhouse.

<br>	Eugene Wei (33:20):
<br>	I certainly think there's something to the idea that humans are wired to be very, very conscious of status. And that it may have come from another time in mankind's history when your status within your small tribe or group was actually critical to your survival.
<br>	Status Games with Eugene Wei (Product Lead at Amazon, Hulu, Erly, Flipboard, Oculus) and James Currier - NOVEMBER 10TH, 2020 | 49:27 | E55
<br>
<br>	Your Status as a Service essay has made the rounds. You basically break social networks down in that article into three axes; utility, status, and then entertainment. And let's talk about the first two and what lessons that we think startup founders can learn from this. Is there an order of operations when you're building a product, when you're building a network? Are we looking primarily for utility? Are we looking for status? Both? I'd love to dive in there.
<br>
<br>	EPISODE SUMMARY
<br>	Status can be a volatile, powerful driver of engagement. Status and one of its underlying mechanisms, scarcity must be considered by product designers in every category, as early on as possible. But it can also be a double-edged sword, as managing a network and the status dynamics within it is constantly recirculating, always shifting. For this reason, status that is more entertainment-based than utility-based can over time become precarious, as well as too restrictive for continued user growth. NFX partner James Currier sits down with Eugene Wei (Product Lead at Amazon, Hulu, Erly, Flipboard, Oculus) to draw from his original Status-as-a-Service article and expand to discuss status in entertainment, frameworks for emotional product design, video games as world leaders in defining scarcity, the future of virtual goods, and the underlying status games that drive us all -- in technology and in life.
