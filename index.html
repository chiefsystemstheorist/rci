<br>	[] Ways to do Market Sizing - Benedict Evans
<br>	Products being cheaper and better is necessary, but it's insufficient:if billions of people can afford it, it doesn't follow that billions of people will buy it. Pricing is only one dynamic - once the price falls below a certain level it stops mattering. So in unknown markets, to work out market size, you have to work out who will care if it is cheap. Sometimes when you're not sure about the market, you'll have to make an imaginative leap into the unknown [like how steve jobs took that leap by believing that, PCs will change the way how the world works and typewriters will fade away once PCs are in]. You have to say 'I believe' that this experience will be transformative, and everyone on earth who has the money will get one.
<br>	
<br>	It's easier to predict 'cheaper and better' than to predict the changes in behaviour that will come from that. You need to have a theory as to why more and more people will care.
<br><h4>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h4>
<br>	[1] feeling and credence —
<br>	learn to detach the conviction from the statistics: You can still enter the mental state we refer to as "certainty that you're going to win", without in fact predicting victory with high credence.
<br>	Our language and our culture and our poorly designed brains make it very easy to conflate feelings with beliefs. For instance, there's this feeling that correlates with extreme confidence that we call "certainty," and thus, it's easy to imagine that that state is only accessible to people with extremely high confidence in some relevant proposition. But the feeling and the credence don't have to come in lockstep — the two can be disentangled.
<br>	Where a straw rationalist might feel the beginning glimmers of conviction or excitement or hope, and then squash it with a thought such as "but statistically this is very likely to fail", I simply... don't squash the glimmer. Because "statistically this is likely to fail" just doesn't bear on the feeling, from my perspective. I'm allowed to feel hopeful about a thing even while being well-calibrated on its chances of success. I'm allowed to feel conviction before a race, even if I'm well-calibrated about my odds. I don't need to lose the useful mental stances, simply because I'm better-calibrated.
<br>	Just because we call the feeling "certainty" doesn't mean that you're only allowed to feel it when your confidence is unreasonably high.
<br>	[2] Profit is the ultimate shiled against bullshit. When you're profitable you don't have to play games, succumb to substistutional metrics, cross your fingers, or grovel for other other people's oney, validation, or acceptance. You simply make more money than you spend--and run a fundamentally sound, econimcs 101 business. When profit's a requirement, it becomes a lot harder to step in the bullshit.

<br>	[3] The Entire e-commerce P&L is architected to make it almost impossible for you to generate EBITDA.
<br>	E-commerce is a bear - Andy Dunn.
<br>	
<br>	[4] "Nobody cares about your product. they just want their problem solved." -- Alison Faulkner, The Alison Show.
<br>	When building a product, most folks kinda get selfish. They end up building it for themselves, to put their skills at work, to appease their sense of design, to build something they believe is "cool", where is the *customer* and his/her problem in all that? And what is a business without customers at the end of the day? -- Vijay Anand (@thestartupguy), The Startup Centre.
