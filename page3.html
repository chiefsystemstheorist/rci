<br> I actually think that people in the gaming world have more of an intuitive understanding of how important it is, moment to moment, to track your user's emotional valence. And that's partially because game designers sort of... Games are a continuous interactive experiences. 
<br>And if the user isn't feeling the right balance of challenged, plus motivated, plus rewarded in a game, they'll churn out. But I think that same principle can be applied to a lot of other products. How products take off a lot of it is in how they make you feel. If you watch any Apple keynote, going back to the Steve Jobs days, I think he is underrated for having this very intuitive understanding. That part of why people should buy Apple products or part of why they buy Apple products is that it makes them feel cool or it makes them feel hip, or it makes them feel creative. That applies to social networks just as much.

<br> Game meaning people judge you based on the content you create.

<br> utlimately, users are playing the game knowingly or unknowingly. Users are optimizing their social/online presence for something. 
<br> [\] for content posted by your friends(people) or pages(publishers) and to connect with friends
<br> [\] for building an audience [every creator is a political party - cult x political party][[<a href="https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/">1,000 True Fans? Try 100 by Li Jin</a>]] or
<br> [\] for making friends on the internet and communities, for that social-connection part, or more like trying to find your tribe, as said in 'We're all tribes' - by seth godin.
<br> those who play well, can climb up the ladder. 
<br> users can become creators, influencers, micro-famous and celebrities.
<br> rather these are all places to get fame, internet famous.
<br> this is my bet - and just like everyone else, we need to create scarcity. we could try to simulate a scarcity of oppurtunities.
<br> make it look like there's an abundance of oppurtunities, unlike the scarcity of it's supply in the real-world.

<br> " But becoming ‘microfamous’ puts people at the centre of an uncomfortable social dynamic. As Danny said:
<br>
There are people out there who know something about you, but you have relatively little knowledge about them.
<br>
This becomes problematic because the microfamous rarely have the resources that the truly famous do to protect their privacy. But more importantly, it creates a disconnect, an unbalanced power relationship that we don’t really have the societal experience to understand. Knowledge is, after all, power."
