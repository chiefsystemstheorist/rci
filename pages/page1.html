    With some of us having hundreds of tabs open all the time across a number of windows, browser is critical and context-switching becomes hard as OS isn't designed for multi-tasking all the time. 
    Shortcuts being contextual is proof that windows is so outdated with user-behaviour.
    The problems surrounding our digital spaces (and these cognitive spaces that we create) are far bigger than just browsers themselves, ideally we need to rethink the metaphors of interfaces from the ground up.

    --------------------------
    --------------------------
    --------------------------

    <br>As long as I have foldered/tagged properly, I can easily find it when needed and maybe re-read it and try to, retain most of what I read.	
    <br>Each time we click that bookmark button on a tweet, we'd have a thought how we could save it the best way, so that the next time I need to refer this great idea it'll be easy for me to resurface it.
    <br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <br>Even if I don't get back to it, naming is indexing, hence archived but searchable (resurfacing). you might not understand it now, but you sure might. again, this was actually written for me.
    
    <br>
    <br>


    <br>	what would happen if we tried to index it all, all the content on the Internet under topics, just as we folder articles in reading apps like Pocket / Instapaper.
    <br>	because users are basically submitting links
    <br>	\[1\] saving is validation that it is important to them.
    <br>adding weights(domain authority) for better prioritizing led me to think saving is indexing and engaging is ranking
    <br>all content posted is evaluated by us wherein we assign it values like like, share, subscribe, save, comment - based on how much we resonate with it. 
    <br>    /2/ we need to acknowledge the fact that, we're the ones in-charge of regualting of our feed. 
    <br> we're actually living in echochambers, wherein we trust that certain users will post good content

    <!--feed quality-->
    <br>These are the controls social-media platforms come with. 
    <br>It's just that social-platforms don't yet realize that using these controls itself will help reduce this overwhelming feeling that we're drowing in the content overload.
    <br> acknowledging the fact that the user is the curator (people and publishers I follow) and that he could do better. 
    
    a place to learn anything, since search would be better here.
    one interesting pattern I found among readers in twitter is that, quality pieces of content they come across in their feeds cannot be found in google search results, by a noob who is trying to learn that topic.
    Only because they follow certain people on twitter, they’re able to access such content and google cannot give you that, as it unnecessarily searches through a lot of noise and also only based on the combinations of keywords you enter. Maybe I'm not articulating it properly. It seems it's like Google is running a contest to decide who should be shown in the 1st page of SERP, after which only a set of people will have entered the 2nd page (have ownership of certain keyword combinations) IN Google's state-of-the-art Search Engine.  Search through quality instead search keyword relevancy.

    <br>	For quickly deciding what to read and what to skip. 
<br>	helps the algorithm which are more of a priority and which ones you could to miss out
<br>	In this Lists ([[<a href="benevan.html">Lists are the new SEARCH</a>]]), it's not signal v. noise.
<br>	Almost always every article might be equally interesting and you'll be having a hard time saying no to it.
<br>    since by default everything that comes inside the reading app is chosen by you, 
<br>    by default everything that comes in is considered a signal, and it's our job to figure which ones might be a great read.

<br>At the time of bookmarking itself we can ask him for inputs ? we might get to know how important it is to him.
<br>when the user gives contextual inputs like for the author, for the blog, for the headline, all three.,, or something similar, that tries to capture as much info as possible for the algorithm to decide how important it is to the user,, it becomes easier to prioritize.

<br> That is an interesting problem - creating, naming and remembering spaces. Can a space have a name, a real name before it exists and can be experienced? How does naming a space influence its content? </p>
<p>\\ Naming workspaces, may be flow-breaking meta-question. "How should I call what I'm doing right now" is not always an easy question to answer. </p>
<p>Bringing loads of content into words, will help segment content based on words and easily bring every tab (cognitive-space) under words.</p>
<!-- naming/ labelling/ tagging/ foldering = indexing -->
<br>workona on March 26, 2018 [–]    
<br>We think it’s important to have a name to use as a handle to reference later or your workspaces quickly turn into your tab graveyard. The last thing we want is for people to say “I have no idea what any of this is.”
<br>
<br>
<p> If you don’t want to give it a name, that’s fine, just don’t close the window. When you’re ready to close it, take a moment to give it a name you can remember it by, then shut it.
</p>

<br>establish intent clearly before getting it inside the information system (i.e, Pocket)
<br> Sometimes so clear that they have to set aside time to read this, they go on to schedule it on their calendar app.
<br>

<br>saving/bookmarking[threading/ foldering/ tagging] = indexing 
<br>sending, sharing to wall, posting as story = how good it is, just like how we calculate which ones are viral based <br>on no. of RTs, we can do the same for links as well.
<br>based on no. of saves, [resurfaces], repurposes, enhancers(like), no. of conversations it started (comments section da basically) 
<br>we could say all these weights are added and called domain-authority, which is actually a number to tell how good the domain is.
<br> assuming network effects kick in. Lol.

    <br>[2] search - what clarity is, is different to different people, but for me it is being able to retrieve stuff (cognitive spaces/ mental-sessions, or it could be articles/ tweets) instantly on command.
    
<br> It's hard to resurface stuff I saved, we'll speak of this briefly in the upcoming links. [[page 2 ]]
<br>    I get more links from newsletters than through social-media platforms, and since, it's not like all good content was written recently, we keep resurfacing older but quality links. This only proves that how old is not a parameter.
n1 content dies soon
<br>	// resurfacing = reduces search area or prioritizes where to search first search.

    <br>	m2 contextual
    <br>	we keep forgetting with time. 
    <br>	open tabs being cognitive spaces - which I think act in similar ways to physical spaces in the real world.
    <br>	For example, I will sometimes open a new tab and forget what I came to search for - just like how people will sometimes walk from one room to another and forget what they were trying to do / find and have to (mentally or otherwise) retrace their steps.
    <br>	[indexing conversations]
    <br>	The same applies to conversations, remember those instances, you keep speaking of something enthusiastically, but then somewhere on the way you forget what you were telling in the first place.
    <br>	You don't get me ? ok, think of the no. of times, you've wondered how did I end up thinking this, and you'll start thinking backwards, reverse engineering how you landed there, by resurfacing(replaying) whatever cues came before
    <br>	At first, triggered by some cue, I land in a thought and then it becomes a train of thought, and then trains of thoughts and then what, it becomes really hard to keep track of it all.
    <br>	Browsing also happens similarly, Do you have any clue how you ended up here ? [refer /surfing/]
        
    <br>	Remembering why you opened that tab or why you entered that room, is like trying to remember the thought-trains that led you there.
    <br>	It's similar to bringing certain thought-trains/ cognitivespaces/ tabs back from the dead - [resurfacing](https://www.notion.so/resurfacing-e179f7e1d3e14520b6eaa0511aecdfab).
    <br>	resurfacing (excerpts/ highlights of text you read), through readwise is literally but unconsciously and actively as well, processing stuff.
    <br>	- [active recall] = resurfacing, remembering why you opened {thought-trains}
    <br>	- spaced repetition, incremental reading
    <br>	remember the times you were reading a tweet, but you clicked on some notification or the feed reloaded, and you lost that tweet forever. 
    closing apps in app-tray is actively deleting context
    as you keep opening apps, the app tray gets filled and current systems aren't helping me with this much multi-tasking. It's so overwhelming.
    Keyboard shortcuts being contextual itself is validation that people keep swithcing a lot of apps 
    and that shortcuts have to be common across the device, for shortcuts to be adopted.
    
    each tab we opened is just to hint of what they're actually looking for.
    [[1]] it cannot be open forever
    tabs are ephemeral
    (1) optimal save limit

    <br> but with context we can find it easily when needed.
    -why we need context ?
    <p>     I save a set of bookmarks on a topic over a period of time, but it isn't easy to get access to all of those bookmarks again. Searching doesn't quite accomplish the goal because I might have been looking into a similar topic months ago, but a search will return results from both "mental sessions" together and I have to separate them myself.</p>	
    <p> mental-sessions are our journeys through cognitive spaces which we keep forgetting with time, where we keep accumulating thoughts {search, overlap threads, 
    find closest matching threads and add = "cognitive spaces", ""}</p>
    <p>	 What I want is to maintain a list of current references, preferably with some spatial context (tree-mode browsing is great for this) to what the relationship is between pages in my browser session. I do not need is for every last single page to be open at the same time, sucking down memory, CPU cycles, and worse: playing videos and/or making noise. This is an excerpt from <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/256lxu/tabbed_browsing_a_lousy_bandaid_over_poor_browser/">Tabbed browsing: a lousy band-aid over poor browser document and state management</a></p>
    <br>  example use-case: searching within past mental-sessions/ threads, to find tabs related to the tab you're looking for.


    <br>	1 search recommendations (better search)
    <br>	what if resurfacing requires tokens ?
    <br>	Ads  or subscription choose wisely ?
    <br>	If we could aggregate exclusive content of celebrity artists in a platform (supply), where (demand) users need to buy  fungible tokens of that platform
    <br>	We could sell art as NFTs or crypto as currency in a platform (like coins to view content in a platform)
    <br>	Artists need NFTs + crypto
