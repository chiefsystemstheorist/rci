bookmarks are basically the internet I set aside for later consumption and power-users foldering bookmarks seems like users are creating an index for their bookmarks. 


prioritizing the home-feed
There's too much content content and it's hard to know which ones are worthwhile before consuming it.

indexing  properly from the beginning might actually control the inflow of information in the system [enter Google as a search engine & Browser (The Internet), Twitter, Instagram, conversations in Clubhouse]  

establish intent clearly before getting it inside the information system (i.e, Pocket)
<br>	As long as I have foldered/tagged properly, I can easily find it when needed and maybe re-read it and try to, retain most of what I read.	

Each time we click that bookmark button on a tweet, we'd have a thought how we could save it the best way, so that the next time I need to refer this great idea it'll be easy for me to resurface it.
\\ Naming workspaces, may be flow-breaking meta-question. "How should I call what I'm doing right now" is not always an easy question to answer.
--------------------------------------------- \- comments from Hacker News
workona on March 26, 2018 [–] We think it’s important to have a name to use as a handle to reference later or your workspaces quickly turn into your tab graveyard. The last thing we want is for people to say “I have no idea what any of this is.”
If you don’t want to give it a name, that’s fine, just don’t close the window. When you’re ready to close it, take a moment to give it a name you can remember it by, then shut it.
spython on March 26, 2018 [–] That is an interesting problem - creating, naming and remembering spaces. Can a space have a name, a real name before it exists and can be experienced? How does naming a space influence its content?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Even if I don't get back to it, naming is indexing, hence archived but searchable (resurfacing). you might not understand it now, but you sure might. again, this was actually written for me.

this could be the 3 buckets    
<br>	we have a various reasons why we want to those links (urls)	    
3 buckets - unread, read, just-in-case [Everything goes to pocket forever and later when you're working on a specific topic (or) want to learn something, do a keyword search and it'll resurface the relevant ones]
        (1) seems interesting (just-in-case)(just open it in background and leave it to rot)
<br>	(2) text that makes you say "nobody put it this way" (indexing) - for future reference \[read or started reading\] 
<br>	(3)	THINGS YOU WANT TO GET BACK TO, like for sure. We basically hoard articles and It is like a dump to most of us. //more tweets as validation.

resurfacing part --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
m2 contextual
<br>	we keep forgetting with time. 
<br>	open tabs being cognitive spaces - which I think act in similar ways to physical spaces in the real world.
<br>	For example, I will sometimes open a new tab and forget what I came to search for - just like how people will sometimes walk from one room to another and forget what they were trying to do / find and have to (mentally or otherwise) retrace their steps.
<br>	[indexing conversations]
<br>	The same applies to conversations, remember those instances, you keep speaking of something enthusiastically, but then somewhere on the way you forget what you were telling in the first place.
<br>	You don't get me ? ok, think of the no. of times, you've wondered how did I end up thinking this, and you'll start thinking backwards, reverse engineering how you landed there, by resurfacing(replaying) whatever cues came before
<br>	At first, triggered by some cue, I land in a thought and then it becomes a train of thought, and then trains of thoughts and then what, it becomes really hard to keep track of it all.
<br>	Browsing also happens similarly, Do you have any clue how you ended up here ? [refer /surfing/]
    
<br>	Remembering why you opened that tab or why you entered that room, is like trying to remember the thought-trains that led you there.
<br>	It's similar to bringing certain thought-trains/ cognitivespaces/ tabs back from the dead - [resurfacing](https://www.notion.so/resurfacing-e179f7e1d3e14520b6eaa0511aecdfab).
<br>	resurfacing (excerpts/ highlights of text you read), through readwise is literally but unconsciously and actively as well, processing stuff.
<br>	- [active recall] = resurfacing, remembering why you opened {thought-trains}
<br>	- spaced repetition, incremental reading
<br>	remember the times you were reading a tweet, but you clicked on some notification or the feed reloaded, and you lost that tweet forever. 
closing apps in app-tray is actively deleting context
as you keep opening apps, the app tray gets filled and current systems aren't helping me with this much multi-tasking. It's so overwhelming.
Keyboard shortcuts being contextual itself is validation that people keep swithcing a lot of apps 
and that shortcuts have to be common across the device, for shortcuts to be adopted.

<br> but with context we can find it easily when needed.
-why we need context ?
<p>     I save a set of bookmarks on a topic over a period of time, but it isn't easy to get access to all of those bookmarks again. Searching doesn't quite accomplish the goal because I might have been looking into a similar topic months ago, but a search will return results from both "mental sessions" together and I have to separate them myself.</p>	
<p> mental-sessions are our journeys through cognitive spaces which we keep forgetting with                 time, where we keep accumulating thoughts {search, overlap threads, 
find closest matching threads and add = "cognitive spaces", ""}</p>
<p>	 What I want is to maintain a list of current references, preferably with some spatial context (tree-mode browsing is great for this) to what the relationship is between pages in my browser session. I do not need is for every last single page to be open at the same time, sucking down memory, CPU cycles, and worse: playing videos and/or making noise. This is an excerpt from <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/256lxu/tabbed_browsing_a_lousy_bandaid_over_poor_browser/">Tabbed browsing: a lousy band-aid over poor browser document and state management</a></p>
<br>  example use-case: searching within past mental-sessions/ threads, to find tabs related to the tab you're looking for.


At the time of bookmarking itself we can ask him for inputs ? we might get to know how important it is to him.
Trying to understand the query entered and finding the relavant content for those keywords. But there cannot be consensus on 1st 10 links for a certain keyword. Consensus is multi-player. [[<a href="m2 contextual.html">consensus</a>]]

reading apps are where millions of users consume the content they bookmarked earlier.
it's not like medium or substack, but reading apps could perform in discovery as well. Users could actually build distribution here.

<br> but for that to happen, they need to migrate here pocket was doing nothing

Every piece of incoming link is 


caching content happens as we browse the Internet, it also includes us scrolling through aggregators like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook.  
As end-consumers we consume a lot of diverse content across a number of platforms
To a significant percent of users, instagram is the internet they know, or twitter is the internet they know, reddit and google is their internet, it depends from person to person. 
Hence indexing just webpages will not cut it, all file formats of content across platforms all are part of the Internet. 
articles are just one of the [file-formats](https://www.notion.so/file-formats-8e6aa86afe4349ec91a40af035a52418)
The user not being able to keep up with his saving activity, frustrated due to FOMO on the most recent tweets of all those you follow and increasing load of articles which you never seem to complete, is totally unnecessary.

what would happen if we tried to index it all, all the content on the Internet under topics.
because users are basically submitting links
\[1\] saving is validation
I understood users themselves are indexing by saving it somewhere and they feel guilty for not going back to it. FOMO.
    
Once you add signals or index it properly, it all comes into perspective and it’s gonna be lit innit. avlodhaan da.
all content posted is evaluated by us wherein we assign it values like like, share, subscribe, save, comment - based on how much we resonate with it. 
some people go on to repost it, retweet it, post as story/ status, and this behaviour is seen in people who want to be identified as something or to make people aware or clearly for dopamine.
