        When we look at trends in consumption of online content and the "rules" holding us back, we can sum them up into one major bottleneck: We are still broadcasting journalism, while new digital content distribution platform players are offering deeply personal experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
        Publishers are left with a simple choice: Either lead the charge to redefine journalism and their products, or become mere content providers for external platforms, making them the de facto publishers of our time. The next leap will be going from broadcasting journalism(one-size-fits-all) to 1:1 journalism. - tinius trust. 💯

        <br>	we keep forgetting with time. 
        <br>	open tabs being cognitive spaces - which I think act in similar ways to physical spaces in the real world.
        <br>	For example, I will sometimes open a new tab and forget what I came to search for - just like how people will sometimes walk from one room to another and forget what they were trying to do / find and have to (mentally or otherwise) retrace their steps.
        <br>	[indexing conversations]
        <br>	The same applies to conversations, remember those instances, you keep speaking of something enthusiastically, but then somewhere on the way you forget what you were telling in the first place.
        <br>	You don't get me ? ok, think of the no. of times, you've wondered how did I end up thinking this, and you'll start thinking backwards, reverse engineering how you landed there, by resurfacing(replaying) whatever cues came before
        <br>	At first, triggered by some cue, I land in a thought and then it becomes a train of thought, and then trains of thoughts and then what, it becomes really hard to keep track of it all.
        <br>	Browsing also happens similarly, Do you have any clue how you ended up here ? [refer /surfing/]
            
        <br>	Remembering why you opened that tab or why you entered that room, is like trying to remember the thought-trains that led you there.
        <br>	It's similar to bringing certain thought-trains/ cognitivespaces/ tabs back from the dead - [resurfacing](https://www.notion.so/resurfacing-e179f7e1d3e14520b6eaa0511aecdfab).
        <br>	resurfacing (excerpts/ highlights of text you read), through readwise is literally but unconsciously and actively as well, processing stuff.
        <br>	- [active recall] = resurfacing, remembering why you opened {thought-trains}
        <br>	- spaced repetition, incremental reading
        <br>	remember the times you were reading a tweet, but you clicked on some notification or the feed reloaded, and you lost that tweet forever. 
        closing apps in app-tray is actively deleting context
        as you keep opening apps, the app tray gets filled and current systems aren't helping me with this much multi-tasking. It's so overwhelming.
        Keyboard shortcuts being contextual itself is validation that people keep swithcing a lot of apps 
        and that shortcuts have to be common across the device, for shortcuts to be adopted.
        
        each tab we opened is just to hint of what they're actually looking for.
        [[1]] it cannot be open forever
        tabs are ephemeral
        (1) optimal save limit
    
        <br> but with context we can find it easily when needed.
        -why we need context ?
        <p>     I save a set of bookmarks on a topic over a period of time, but it isn't easy to get access to all of those bookmarks again. Searching doesn't quite accomplish the goal because I might have been looking into a similar topic months ago, but a search will return results from both "mental sessions" together and I have to separate them myself.</p>	
        <p> mental-sessions are our journeys through cognitive spaces which we keep forgetting with                 time, where we keep accumulating thoughts {search, overlap threads, 
        find closest matching threads and add = "cognitive spaces", ""}</p>
        <p>	 What I want is to maintain a list of current references, preferably with some spatial context (tree-mode browsing is great for this) to what the relationship is between pages in my browser session. I do not need is for every last single page to be open at the same time, sucking down memory, CPU cycles, and worse: playing videos and/or making noise. This is an excerpt from <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/256lxu/tabbed_browsing_a_lousy_bandaid_over_poor_browser/">Tabbed browsing: a lousy band-aid over poor browser document and state management</a></p>
        <br>  example use-case: searching within past mental-sessions/ threads, to find tabs related to the tab you're looking for.

    bookmarks are basically the internet I set aside for later consumption and power-users foldering bookmarks seems like users are creating an index for their bookmarks. 
    
    prioritizing the home-feed
    There's too much content content and it's hard to know which ones are worthwhile before consuming it.
    
    indexing  properly from the beginning might actually control the inflow of information in the system [enter Google as a search engine & Browser (The Internet), Twitter, Instagram, conversations in Clubhouse]  
    
    establish intent clearly before getting it inside the information system (i.e, Pocket)
    <br>	As long as I have foldered/tagged properly, I can easily find it when needed and maybe re-read it and try to, retain most of what I read.

    With some of us having hundreds of tabs open all the time across a number of windows, browser is critical and context-switching becomes hard as OS isn't designed for multi-tasking all the time. 
    Shortcuts being contextual is proof that windows is so outdated with user-behaviour.Pirate flag
    The problems surrounding our digital spaces (and these cognitive spaces that we create) are far bigger than just browsers themselves, ideally we need to rethink the metaphors of interfaces from the ground up.

    caching content happens as we browse the Internet, it also includes us scrolling through aggregators like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook.  
    As end-consumers we consume a lot of diverse content across a number of platforms
    To a significant percent of users, instagram is the internet they know, or twitter is the internet they know, reddit and google is their internet, it depends from person to person. 
    Hence indexing just webpages will not cut it, all file formats of content across platforms all are part of the Internet. 
    articles are just one of the [file-formats](https://www.notion.so/file-formats-8e6aa86afe4349ec91a40af035a52418)
    The user not being able to keep up with his saving activity, frustrated due to FOMO on the most recent tweets of all those you follow and increasing load of articles which you never seem to complete, is totally unnecessary.
    
    what would happen if we tried to index it all, all the content on the Internet under topics.
    because users are basically submitting links
    \[1\] saving is validation
    I understood users themselves are indexing by saving it somewhere and they feel guilty for not going back to it. FOMO.
    
    every piece of content has a weight attached to it by the user.  
    all content posted is evaluated by us wherein we assign it values like like, share, subscribe, save, comment - based on how much we resonate with it. 
    weights are an indicator  signals like - author = must-read-author / must-read-blog, and type of content = comments/ notes/ annotations of must-read-author on tweets (or) articles, notes on tweets.  [[UGC]]
    
    Once you add signals or index it properly, it all comes into perspective and it’s gonna be lit innit. avlodhaan da.
    some people go on to repost it, retweet it, post as story/ status, and this behaviour is seen in people who want to be identified as something or to make people aware or clearly for dopamine.
    
    If the signal part is shown in highly noisy environments, it helps the user to better decide, if it deserves his/her attention, or even they'd be ready to give more attention to those which are pure signal.  quickly deciding what to read and what to skip.
    each UX component conveys some information to the user about either navigation  
    or  
    when it's noisy, to control noise or for noise-control, we can brand certain content as Pure SIGNAL, some as noise.  
    
    adding signals to channels to measure authenticity and domain authority
    ex: article(author), tweet(techtwitter), platform(memes(friends))

    speaking of all the content on the Internet, 
    much of what is created by the masses belong to platforms which google cannot crawl through and resurface just-in-time on command. 
    I have no idea, why GOOG is not able to resurface tweets ?, but I'm pretty sure a lot of people are looking for a way to search through their twitter bookmarks, which twitter unfortunately doesn't allow.

    I'm not saying google sucks, they grew so big, they grew blind, they're not able to see that 
    All I'm saying is that,

        Can make those with lots of tabs trying to organize them, do it faster by asking them to bookmark all tabs —> import to us —> sort it out here (new thread, add to old thread, delete tab) I closed a few tabs today. I think I’m finally making progress- I’m only at 104 open as of today.
