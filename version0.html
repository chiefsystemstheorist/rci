<br> \[2\] As end-consumers we consume a lot of diverse content across a number of platforms, and bookmarking is an inherent behaviour in users. 
<br> we have a various reasons why we want to those links. 
<br> why we bookmark ? <a href="https://bytebaker.com/2010/10/05/why-bookmark/">link</a>
<br> I made 3 buckets - unread, read, just-in-case 
<br> (1) read - text that makes you say "nobody put it this way" - for future reference \[read or started reading\] (consider we're creating scarcity with them indexing) 
<br> (2) unread / half-read - Things you want to get back to, like for sure. (reading queue)
<br> (3) unread - seems interesting (just-in-case)(just open it in background and leave it to rot)
<br>
<br> each reason is a persona in itself and I'll get into it slowly.
<br> It seems you'll start dumping articles into read-later apps, just-in-case you need it later. 
<br> Users are frustrated, they cannot keep up with their hoarding habit. We hoard articles and never get back to them. Links are dying everyday.

<h4> why we need to be working on this ? </h4>
<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:black;background-color:black">
<br> The Internet basically democratized a lot of things. It reduced the information assymmetry, but we're consuming content at an unimaginable rate. It's hard to know which ones are worthwhile before consuming it.

<h4>curation is the problem of the century</h4> 
<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:black;background-color:black">

<br>"Hence, I always thought the most appealing part of Flipboard was the manually curated directory of sites to follow. It's a list of lists, but it isn't trying to encompass everything, and so, unlike Yahoo, it isn't unmanageably big. But that just relocates the problem - what if you want a list that isn't on the list of lists? If you wanted to find 5 new sites to read about a topic you care about - ice-climbing, or vintage furniture, or experimental electronic music, or children's picture books - where would you find it? Can you create a platform for all those lists without turning into Yahoo? And it's worth remembering that Google hasn't actually solved this either - it might give you one blog post, but not a list of 20 sites to try. (Indeed, one could suggest that blogs themselves break Google in some sense - you're looking for a stream, but Google can only give you the post.)"

<br> From the publisher's PoV, (publisher's = individual creators (people and pages))
<br> They have to keep posting (that too consistently) according to the algorithm of that aggregator (1) to get picked up by the algorithm, to be shown in more no. of feeds (feeds of users who might find it relevant) and (2) to get ranked in the 1st page. Also, in social-media platforms, publisher's posts might get lost in the feed. [[n1]]
<br> But, Email is a direct relationship with the reader. Hence, Newsletters > having to get ranked in a feed (social-media platforms and SERPs). 
<br> Readers don't go to the website (or) social-media page of that publisher (or) mail app directly. They'd read it either in the feed itself (or) mail app itself (or) save it for later.
<br>
<br>We get our links from one of these 3 places - 
<br> [1] Feeds(social-meida platforms) { Feeds =  twitter, linkedin, reddit, tumblr, instagram, facebook.etc }
<br> [2] Newsletters 
<br> [3] Browsing(SERPs and backlinks)
<br>
<br> You may get your links from anywhere, but for some people, reading apps are the final destination where they consume the content they saved for later.  #1
<br>
<br> eventually they could consolidate all reading to one place
<br>
<br> Reading apps are where a set of people go to first thing they open their phone. 
everyone came there for a reason and eventually they have to realize more reasons to come there.
<br>
<br> People submit their sites to google for it to crawl, index and serve it to end-users.
<br> [1] On the other hand, bookmarks are basically the internet I set aside for later consumption and [2] and power-users foldering bookmarks seems like users are creating an index for their bookmarks.
<br> Indexing is being done by the reader himself, as he is basically weaving his demonstrable understanding, by naming the space properly during consumption itself, making collections of links about topics he knows about in depth. This is just my observation.
<br> We need to realize that the user is actually submitting links to the reading app, but then it has remained chronological all this while. 

<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:black;background-color:black">
<br>curation is not the problem, I'm trying to solve,...
<br>All I'm saying is, by helping them with reading and retaining more, we become their default reading app.

<br> And, the use of query-modifiers is enough validation that, Google is not serving quality content. It has more generic SEO-centric content in it SERPs.

<br>
<br> One interesting pattern I found among readers in twitter is that, quality pieces of content they come across in their feeds cannot be found in google search results, by a noob who is trying to learn that topic. 
<br> Only because they follow certain people on twitter, they’re able to access such content and google cannot give you that, as it unnecessarily searches through a lot of noise and that too only based on the combinations of keywords you enter (this is a skill in itself). Maybe I'm not articulating it properly. It seems it's like Google is running a contest to decide who should be shown in the 1st page of SERPs (have temporary ownership over certain keyword combinations) in Google's state-of-the-art Search Engine.  

<br>a place to learn anything, since search might be better here.
<br>better SERPs (basic logic that my friend who knows about it can guide me better than GOOG). Searching those keywords inside the reading lists of people you follow here would give better results than google, but the user is still in an echochamber.

<br> It seems like users creating folders of links is them basically creating scarcity.

<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:black;background-color:black">
<br>eventually it could be a single place for (or) go-to place for a lot of things

<br>    but then again, it'll become yet another noisy feed. example - matter app
<br> so, stick to being a reading queue. 

<p>	Discussions in twitter is where knowledge is rated. It is much more valuable than the comments on the article inside the blog. Ideas are the currency here.</p>

<br>(1) making people read here and (2) be able to discover great content here, 
<br>once the above happens - 
<br>we could try to consolidate comments of articles here. Right now, comments are divided btw the site where it is posted, and other social media (it's a link that can be shared and spoken of anywhere)) and consolidating them would be a very big feat. 

<br>I believe making this the best place to read by fixing the current problem of pocket being a dump, would be the starting point as told before.

<br>As we look at the gamification of everything, we realized that the world had been gamified before with U.S. News & World Report publishing the list of colleges in 1981, which has set off this mad, crazy game about getting into college and achieving status and that sort of thing. They created this scarcity. Who's number one? Who's in the top 10? Who's in the top 50? What other ways are you seeing people create scarcity that then produces energy for people or produces businesses?
<br>Eugene Wei (17:05):
<br>Yeah. That's a great question. I love your U.S. News & World Report example. A lot of, I feel like, the tension from the last generation of media to this new world of more distributed network media is just that the gatekeepers that used to define scarcity have lost a lot of power in the modern world. <font color="black">And ultimately, if you're allowed to define scarcity on any axis, that is a form of power.</font> So if we were to look at networked apps and things like that, you brought up lists and ranks lists. That's certainly going to continue to be a really important way in which people define scarcity. And that's like working its way through every sort of vertical in the world. I also think there is just like, if we were to look at video games, that's just a metaphor for a lot of us and you study the video game world, and you see that they've become really the leaders in the world at figuring out how to define forms of scarcity.

<br> leaderboards   
<br>    stats for gamification is not simply taking your product and adding points, levels, trophies, and badges. Well, researchers distinguished intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. With intrinsic motivation, we do things because we find them inherently satisfying and interesting. With extrinsic motivation, we do things to achieve rewards. And that’s the problem with rewards – they massively undermine intrinsic motivation. This is also why gamification does not work. When gamification appears to work, it is because the underlying experience is already a game.
<br>/3 What is the simplest behaviour in anticipation of reward ?
<br> I'll give 2 answers, in terms of clout.
<br>(1) the power-user is there for our prioritization first, he really wants to reach pocket zero (zero unread articles) and doesn't give a damn about if he gets any clout out of the nerd he is. 
<br>(2) average users now with leaderboards have this incentive to read, as them reading could be visualised into clout as in github's 365-day coding streak and shades based on certain proof of work.

<br>A recent article in the Harvard Business Review puts a name to this new neurological phenomenon: Attention Deficit Trait. Basically, the terms ADD and ADHD are falling out of use because effectively the entire population fits the diagnostic criteria. It’s not a condition anymore, it’s a trait — the inherent and unavoidable experience of modern life characterized by “distractibility, inner frenzy, and impatience.”

<br>Eugene Wei (02:32):
<br> I actually think that people in the gaming world have more of an intuitive understanding of how important it is, moment to moment, to track your user's emotional valence. And that's partially because game designers sort of... Games are a continuous interactive experiences. 
<br>And if the user isn't feeling the right balance of challenged, plus motivated, plus rewarded in a game, they'll churn out. But I think that same principle can be applied to a lot of other products. How products take off a lot of it is in how they make you feel. If you watch any Apple keynote, going back to the Steve Jobs days, I think he is underrated for having this very intuitive understanding. That part of why people should buy Apple products or part of why they buy Apple products is that it makes them feel cool or it makes them feel hip, or it makes them feel creative. That applies to social networks just as much.
