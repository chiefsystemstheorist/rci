<br>	As end-consumers we consume a lot of diverse content across a number of platforms, and bookmarking is an inherent behaviour in users. 
<br> why we bookmark ? <a href="https://bytebaker.com/2010/10/05/why-bookmark/">link</a>
<br>
<br>1) Bookmarking an item seems to be a very good way to remember stuff, even if you’re never going to look at the bookmark again. <br>Just categorizing a bookmarking with tags, and thinking shortly about it, lets me remember most of the stuff I put in there.
<br>2) Read Later buffer
<br>3) Sharing. Bookmarking an item lets me share it with a lot of people, some of whom are friends, some I know from the web, and some I know not all. I’ve made handful of acquaintances with people with very much the same interests as me.
<br>

<br>-- observed-behaviours --

<br> [1] leave 100s of tabs open for days/ weeks.
<br> [2] hoard articles and never get back to them.
<br> Users are frustrated, they cannot keep up with their hoarding habit.

<br>opening new tabs(thought-trains) is the default behaviour.
<br>\[\[c0 clipboards &amp; interfaces\]\] -- browser
<br>    [1] It is not about reading the content of one page and going on to the next. 
<br>        It is about gathering the relevant data in the sea of nonsense, and leaving the tabs open, «in working  memory», until the gathered data 
<br>        // All the tabs that are open are not open because people forget to close them. Instead, they act like living bookmarks. They are keys to thoughts and ideas, that you want to return to and continue thinking.
<br>
<br> Web pages that we visit and leave open are artifacts of externalized cognition; keys to thinking and remembering.
<br> The browser of today is a transitory space that brings us into a mental state, not just to a specific website destination. And we should design our browsers for this task.

<!--after saving-->
<!-- solving for the overload -->
<br>
<br>	\[1\] Most never go back to them. Links are dying everyday.
<br>	It seems you'll start dumping articles into read-later apps, just-in-case you need it later. And so far, pocket/ instapaper/ diigo and other major players only have a chronological feed of links saved [home-feed].

<br>    As the content overload is increasing, to keep up with all this content, the user has to acknowledge that, 
<br>(1) pocket zero is unreal unlike inbox zero, (2) be cautious of what you bring inside the system.

<br>	we have a various reasons why we want to those links (urls)	   
<br>3 buckets - unread, read, just-in-case 
<br> (1) unread - seems interesting (just-in-case)(just open it in background and leave it to rot)
<br> (2) unread / half-read - Things you want to get back to, like for sure. 
<br> (3) read - text that makes you say "nobody put it this way" (indexing) - for future reference \[read or started reading\] 

<br><p>	The Internet basically democratized a lot of things. It reduced the information assymmetry, but we're creating content at an unimaginable rate and it's hard ot chose what to consume. 

<br>It's hard to say, if we need more curation[3] or better search[2], but feeds are all lists.

<br>It's hard to know which ones are worthwhile before consuming it.

<h4>curation is the problem of the century</h4>

<br><a href"https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2016/1/31/lists-are-the-new-search">Lists are the new search - ben-evans.com | 31 Jan 2016</a> 
<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br> I've become rather fascinated all the people trying to unbundle Yelp for restaurants. People trying to unbundle Craigslist do so with modern UX, but Yelp is a modern company with modern UX, and the people unbundling it, mostly, use constraint. Instead of offering 500 or 1000 restaurants and a search box, they give you a list - 50, or 10, or even 1. Sometimes this is deliberate and sometimes it flows from the business model, but the result is the same - they remove the 'tyranny of choice'. I don't want 500 options for restaurants, all of which I'd like - I want five.
<br>Hence, I always thought the most appealing part of Flipboard was the manually curated directory of sites to follow. It's a list of lists, but it isn't trying to encompass everything, and so, unlike Yahoo, it isn't unmanageably big. But that just relocates the problem - what if you want a list that isn't on the list of lists? <b style="background-color: black; color: white;">If you wanted to find 5 new sites to read about a topic you care about - ice-climbing, or vintage furniture, or experimental electronic music, or children's picture books - where would you find it? Can you create a platform for all those lists without turning into Yahoo? And it's worth remembering that Google hasn't actually solved this either - it might give you one blog post, but not a list of 20 sites to try. (Indeed, one could suggest that blogs themselves break Google in some sense - you're looking for a stream, but Google can only give you the post.)</b>"

<br>"All curation grows until it requires search. All search grows until it requires curation." — Benedict Evans (@benevans) December 18, 2015

<br> 

<br> People submit their sites to google for it to crawl, index and serve it to end-users.
<br> [1] On the other hand, bookmarks are basically the internet I set aside for later consumption and [2] and power-users foldering bookmarks seems like users are creating an index for their bookmarks.
<br> Indexing is being done by the reader himself, as he is basically weaving his demonstrable understanding, by naming the space properly during consumption itself, making collections of links about topics he knows about in depth. This is just my observation.


<br>We need to realize that the user is actually submitting links to the reading app, but then it has remained chronological all this while. 

<br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A Substack of carefully selected links and analysis is helpful, but not if everyone is pushing one.<br><br>Curation is content in itself, masked as a service.</p>&mdash; Matt Klein (@KleinKleinKlein) <a href="https://twitter.com/KleinKleinKlein/status/1340751191572135941?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 20, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New idea from a blog post that has been on my mind a lot the last month: that info overload is not due to filter failure, but filter success. Everything is so good now (or at least alluring) it’s hard to turn away. And having better filters only makes that problem worse</p>&mdash; Tiago Forte (@fortelabs) <a href="https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1075294724330831872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<br>
<br> This is what will control the incoming links, not curation. 
<br><p style="color:red;">index / bookmark | \[1\] [UIC] - home feed (what is now chronological).</p>
<br>
<br>/prioritize/ the unread-links in home-feed, for a better reading experience.
<br> (0) primary goal = sort/ filter/ prioritize feed. the list - curating yourself. 


<br>At the time of bookmarking itself we can ask him for inputs ? we might get to know how important it is to him.
<br>when the user gives contextual inputs like for the author, for the blog, for the headline, all three.,, or something similar, that tries to capture as much info as possible for the algorithm to decide how important it is to the user,, it becomes easier to prioritize.
<br>When saving it, we try to put it under a folder and add appropriate hashtags for us to be able to access it easily the next time around. (power-user)

<br> And How do I do this ? -->
<br> (1) The byproduct of the pursuit of a great product idea, is the content or more like copy, you could use for distribution, to build conviction. 
<br> (2) A beta-list maybe. Build a killer feature-set based on the problems I face, (because anything novel will be totally different/ radical than what was before hence you'd need to design everything from scratch) <!--and if the market validates, I mean if there is traction, I can start running the machine.-->
