<br>
<br> \[2\] As end-consumers we consume a lot of diverse content across a number of platforms. [bookmarking is an inherent behaviour in users]
<br>
<br>
<br> all sorts of text content can be segmented based on where it is posted,
<br> (1) articles, pdfs - publishing platforms and discovery apps
<br> (2) (tweets, linkedin posts, reddit posts, quora answers & posts, facebook posts, captions in Instagram, Tumblr posts.etc) - social-media
<br>
<br> It can be written anywhere and reposted anywhere on the internet. But, there seems to a possibility that an app dedicated to reading for those with high attention spans, just for reading. 
<br> read-later - pocket, instapaper, diigo, abyss.
<br>
<br> Readers(most) don't go to the website directly. They'd read it wherever they found it (feed, mail app) (or) save it for later. 
<br> they have dedicated apps to read articles and pdfs that they saved to them. but then all other sorts of text-first content can only be bookmarked, they cannot be brought to a more centralised information system. 
<br>
<br>We get our links from one of these 3 places - 
<br>anywhere = {
<br> [1] Feeds (social-meida platforms & discovery apps) //Feeds =  twitter, linkedin, reddit, tumblr, instagram, facebook
<br> [2] Newsletters 
<br> [3] Browsing(SERPs and backlinks)
<br> }

<br> You may get your links from anywhere, but for some people, reading apps are the final destination where they consume the content they saved for later.  
<br> Reading apps are where a set of people go to first thing they open their phone, or wish to would go to.


<br>I guess I consider these tweets as validation (couldn't do proper user-research) that all reading apps have so much room to grow. 
<br> for them, reasons to open the app is divided between utility and entertainment.

<br>
<br> we have a various reasons why we want to those links. 
<br> why we bookmark ? <a href="https://bytebaker.com/2010/10/05/why-bookmark/">link</a>
<br> I made 3 buckets - just-in-case, unread, read.
<br> Each reason is a persona in itself and I'll get into it slowly.
<br>
<br> [1] seems interesting (just-in-case) - just open it in background and leave it to rot \[ unread \]
FOMO
<br> [2] Things you want to get back to, like for sure. (reading queue) - \[ unread / started \]
<br> [3] Text that makes you say "nobody put it this way" - for future reference 
\[ read \]

<br> [1]
<br> It seems you'll start dumping articles into read-later apps, just-in-case you need it later. Users are frustrated, they cannot keep up with their hoarding habit. We hoard articles and never get back to them. Links are dying everyday.
<br> And this is the problem they have, based on a utilitarian perspective.

<br> Say, it grows into a single place for (or) go-to place for a lot of things.
<br> We could grow from reading app into a discovery app as well. (actually experiment the shit outta them)

entertainment-based / status axis
--

<br> utlimately, users are playing the game knowingly or unknowingly. 
<br>[[<a href ="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service">status as a service - eugene wei</a>]]
<br>As with cryptocurrency, if it were so easy, it wouldn't be worth anything.<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Value is tied to scarcity, and scarcity on social networks derives from proof of work. Status isn't worth much if there's no skill and effort required to mine it. It's not that a social network that makes it easy for lots of users to perform well can't be a useful one, but competition for relative status still motivates humans.</span> Recall our first tenet: humans are status-seeking monkeys. Status is a relative ladder. By definition, if everyone can achieve a certain type of status, it’s no status at all, it’s a participation trophy.
<br>
<br>Almost every social network of note had an early signature proof of work hurdle. For Facebook it was posting some witty text-based status update. For Instagram, it was posting an interesting square photo. For Vine, an entertaining 6-second video. For Twitter, it was writing an amusing bit of text of 140 characters or fewer. Pinterest? Pinning a compelling photo. You can likely derive the proof of work for other networks like Quora and Reddit and Twitch and so on. Successful social networks don't pose trick questions at the start, it’s usually clear what they want from you.

<br>Now consider, reading articles as entertainment. It seems like we have certain expectations when we read something (utility), but we could also call it entertainment, as not all of us go great lengths to retain what we read. We don't have a clear metric to measure this sort of proof of work. 
<!--According to me, We only read to know just enough. maybe just for the sake of bragging rights, or to win arguments, or for n unknown reasons.
But what is clear is, since we read (consume) a lot of content, by default unless until we go back to it, we might not be able to understand it completely yet.-->

<br>goal - 
<br>(i) power-user - actually get more stuff read 
<br>(ii) average-user - if the user is able to correlate simply roaming inside the app or staying inside longer as being productive or reading more or learning more, we win. 
<br>    stats for gamification is not simply taking your product and adding points, levels, trophies, and badges. Well, researchers distinguished intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. With intrinsic motivation, we do things because we find them inherently satisfying and interesting. With extrinsic motivation, we do things to achieve rewards. And that’s the problem with rewards – they massively undermine intrinsic motivation. This is also why gamification does not work. When gamification appears to work, it is because the underlying experience is already a game.

<br>[[<a href ="https://podcast.nfx.com/episodes/status-games-eugene-wei/transcript">transcripts of NFX Podcast - Status Games with Eugene Wei (Product Lead at Amazon, Hulu, Erly, Flipboard, Oculus) and James Currier</a>]]
EPISODE SUMMARY
Status can be a volatile, powerful driver of engagement. Status and one of its underlying mechanisms, scarcity must be considered by product designers in every category, as early on as possible. But it can also be a double-edged sword, as managing a network and the status dynamics within it is constantly recirculating, always shifting. For this reason, status that is more entertainment-based than utility-based can over time become precarious, as well as too restrictive for continued user growth. (replaceable)

<br>it is for utility and entertainment, based on what the user wants out of it
<br> status games basically evaluate PoW done by user's and rewards them

<br> archived, but searchable

<br> Them using it is based on whatever they see it as, (utility or entertainment) and, what everyone else perceives it also has an influence on the user's perception of the app.

<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:black;background-color:black">


<br>/3 What is the simplest behaviour in anticipation of reward ?
<br> I'll give 2 answers, in terms of clout.
<br>(1) the power-user is there for our prioritization first. He really wants to reach pocket zero and doesn't give a damn about if he gets any clout out of the nerd he is. 
<br>(2) average users now with leaderboards have this incentive to read, as them reading could be visualised into clout as in github's 365-day coding streak and shades based on certain proof of work.
<br> buffer as deadline and for accountability
<br>
<br>Eugene Wei (02:32):
<br> I actually think that people in the gaming world have more of an intuitive understanding of how important it is, moment to moment, to track your user's emotional valence. And that's partially because game designers sort of... Games are a continuous interactive experiences. 
<br>Eugene Wei (03:24):
<br>And if the user isn't feeling the right balance of challenged, plus motivated, plus rewarded in a game, they'll churn out. But I think that same principle can be applied to a lot of other products. How products take off a lot of it is in how they make you feel. If you watch any Apple keynote, going back to the Steve Jobs days, I think he is underrated for having this very intuitive understanding. That part of why people should buy Apple products or part of why they buy Apple products is that it makes them feel cool or it makes them feel hip, or it makes them feel creative. That applies to social networks just as much.

nir
<br> leaderboards   
<br>

<br>incentive to read - leaderboards (social-capital)
<br>children might mark them as read, just to show off. The system might get gamed
<br>"as Mr. Munger says, people tend to game any system you put in place, and then they tend to rationalize that gaming until they believe they really are doing the right thing. I think it was Andy Grove who said that for every goal you put in front of someone, you should also put in place a counter-goal to restrict gaming of the first goal. 
<br> end of the day, who are they fooling ? Hence, only those who come for the utility

my assumption is only those with shelf life greater than a day to a week, get bookmarked.

<br>
<br> One interesting pattern I found among readers in twitter is that, quality pieces of content they come across in their feeds cannot be found in google search results, by a noob who is trying to learn that topic. 
<br> Only because they follow certain people on twitter, they’re able to access such content and google cannot give you that, as it unnecessarily searches through a lot of noise and that too only based on the combinations of keywords you enter (this is a skill in itself). Maybe I'm not articulating it properly. It seems it's like Google is running a contest to decide who should be shown in the 1st page of SERPs (have temporary ownership over certain keyword 
combinations) in Google's state-of-the-art Search Engine.
