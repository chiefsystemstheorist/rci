<br> \[1\] leave 100s of tabs open for days/ weeks.
<!--<br>opening new tabs(thought-trains) is the default behaviour.
<br> \[\[c0 clipboards &amp; interfaces\]\] -- browser-->
<br> It is not about reading the content of one page and going on to the next. 
<br> It is about gathering the relevant data in the sea of nonsense, and leaving the tabs open, « in working  memory », until the gathered data 
<br> // All the tabs that are open are not open because people forget to close them. Instead, they act like living bookmarks. They are keys to thoughts and ideas, that you want to return to and continue thinking.
<br>
<br> Web pages that we visit and leave open are artifacts of externalized cognition; keys to thinking and remembering. The browser of today is a transitory space that brings us into a mental state, not just to a specific website destination. And we should design our browsers for this task.
<!--after saving-->
<!-- solving for the overload -->
<br>
<br> \[2\] As end-consumers we consume a lot of diverse content across a number of platforms, and bookmarking is an inherent behaviour in users. 
<br> why we bookmark ? <a href="https://bytebaker.com/2010/10/05/why-bookmark/">link</a>
<br>
<br> It seems you'll start dumping articles into read-later apps, just-in-case you need it later. 

<br> we have a various reasons why we want to those links (urls)	   
<br> 3 buckets - unread, read, just-in-case 
<br> (1) read - text that makes you say "nobody put it this way" (indexing) - for future reference \[read or started reading\] 
<br> (2) unread - seems interesting (just-in-case)(just open it in background and leave it to rot)
<br> (3) unread / half-read - Things you want to get back to, like for sure. 

<br> Users are frustrated, they cannot keep up with their hoarding habit. We hoard articles and never get back to them. Links are dying everyday.
<br> The Internet basically democratized a lot of things. It reduced the information assymmetry, but we're consuming content at an unimaginable rate. It's hard to know which ones are worthwhile before consuming it.

<h4>curation is the problem of the century</h4>
<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<br>"Hence, I always thought the most appealing part of Flipboard was the manually curated directory of sites to follow. It's a list of lists, but it isn't trying to encompass everything, and so, unlike Yahoo, it isn't unmanageably big. But that just relocates the problem - what if you want a list that isn't on the list of lists? If you wanted to find 5 new sites to read about a topic you care about - ice-climbing, or vintage furniture, or experimental electronic music, or children's picture books - where would you find it? Can you create a platform for all those lists without turning into Yahoo? And it's worth remembering that Google hasn't actually solved this either - it might give you one blog post, but not a list of 20 sites to try. (Indeed, one could suggest that blogs themselves break Google in some sense - you're looking for a stream, but Google can only give you the post.)"

<br>"All curation grows until it requires search. All search grows until it requires curation." — Benedict Evans (@benevans) December 18, 2015

<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br> 
<br> It's hard to say, if we need more curation[3] or better search[2], but feeds are all lists.

<br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New idea from a blog post that has been on my mind a lot the last month: that info overload is not due to filter failure, but filter success.

<br>
<br> As the content overload is increasing, to keep up with all this content, the user has to acknowledge that, <br>(1) pocket zero is unreal unlike inbox zero, <br>(2) be cautious of what you bring inside the system.

<br> This is what will control the incoming links, not curation. 
<br><p style="color:red;">index / bookmark | \[1\] [UIC] - home feed (what is now chronological).</p>
<br>/prioritize/ the unread-links in home-feed, for a better reading experience.
<br> (0) primary goal = sort/ filter/ prioritize feed. the list - curating yourself. 

<br> So far, pocket/ instapaper/ diigo and other major players only have a chronological feed of links saved [home-feed].

<br> At the time of bookmarking itself we can ask him for inputs ? we might get to know how important it is to him.
<br> When the user gives contextual inputs like for the author, for the blog, for the headline, all three.,, or something similar, that tries to capture as much info as possible for the algorithm to decide how important it is to the user,, it becomes easier to prioritize.
<br> When saving it, we try to put it under a folder and add appropriate hashtags for us to be able to access it easily the next time around. (power-user)

<br> for them, reasons to open the app is divided between utility and entertainment.
<br> make it easy for readers to finsih off unread articles (<a href="/readingexperience.html">reading experience</a> [single-player utility])
<br> 
<br> Yes, if we succeed in gathering enough no. of users, we could grow from reading app into a discovery app as well. // aggregating readlists of some of the greatest people (set of quality users in a controlled environment) 
<br>
<br>a place to learn anything, since search would be better here.

<br><p style="color:red;"> search in consumption app (reading app) /platform </p>
<br>better SERPs (basic logic that my friend who knows about it can guide me better than GOOG) - searching those keywords inside the reading lists of people you follow here
<br>
<br> One interesting pattern I found among readers in twitter is that, quality pieces of content they come across in their feeds cannot be found in google search results, by a noob who is trying to learn that topic.
<br> Only because they follow certain people on twitter, they’re able to access such content and google cannot give you that, as it unnecessarily searches through a lot of noise and that too only based on the combinations of keywords you enter (this is a skill in itself). Maybe I'm not articulating it properly. It seems it's like Google is running a contest to decide who should be shown in the 1st page of SERPs (have temporary ownership over certain keyword combinations) in Google's state-of-the-art Search Engine.  
<br> Search through quality instead search keyword relevancy.
<br> And, the use of query-modifiers is enough validation that, Google is not serving quality content. It has more generic SEO-centric content in it SERPs.

<br>    but then again, it'll become yet another noisy feed. example - matter app
<br> so, stick to being a reading queue. 

<p>	Discussions in twitter is where knowledge is rated. It is much more valuable than the comments on the article inside the blog. Ideas are the currency here.</p>

<br>(1) making people read here and (2) be able to discover great content here, 
<br>once the above happens - 
<br>we could try to consolidate comments of articles here. Right now, comments are divided btw the site where it is posted, and other social media (it's a link that can be shared and spoken of anywhere)) and consolidating them would be a very big feat. 
<br>I believe making this the best place to read by fixing the current problem of pocket being a dump, would be the starting point as told before.
<b>a Feed of articles(read/ upvoted/ shared) pooled in from people you follow. [[instilling faith]]


<br> From the publisher's PoV, (publisher's = individual creators (people and pages))
<br> They have to keep posting (that too consistently) according to the algorithm of that aggregator (1) to get picked up by the algorithm, to be shown in more no. of feeds (feeds of users who might find it relevant) and (2) to get ranked in the 1st page. Also, in social-media platforms, publisher's posts might get lost in the feed. [[n1]]
<br> But, Email is a direct relationship with the reader. Hence, Newsletters > having to get ranked in a feed (social-media platforms and SERPs). 
<br> Readers don't go to the website (or) social-media page of that publisher (or) mail app directly. They'd read it either in the feed itself (or) mail app itself (or) save it for later.
<br>
<br>We get our links from one of these 3 places - 
<br> [1] Feeds(social-meida platforms) { Feeds =  twitter, linkedin, reddit, tumblr, instagram, facebook.etc }
<br> [2] Newsletters 
<br> [3] Browsing(SERPs and backlinks)
<br>
<br> You may get your links from anywhere, but for some people, reading apps are the final destination where they consume the content they saved for later.  #1
<br>
<br> eventually they could consolidate all reading to one place
<br>
<br> Reading apps are where a set of people go to first thing they open their phone. 
everyone came there for a reason and eventually they have to realize more reasons to come there.
<br>
<br> People submit their sites to google for it to crawl, index and serve it to end-users.
<br> [1] On the other hand, bookmarks are basically the internet I set aside for later consumption and [2] and power-users foldering bookmarks seems like users are creating an index for their bookmarks.
<br> Indexing is being done by the reader himself, as he is basically weaving his demonstrable understanding, by naming the space properly during consumption itself, making collections of links about topics he knows about in depth. This is just my observation.
<br> We need to realize that the user is actually submitting links to the reading app, but then it has remained chronological all this while.

<br> (1) The byproduct of the pursuit of a great product idea, is the content or more like copy, you could use for distribution, to build conviction. 
<br> (2) A beta-list maybe. Build a killer feature-set based on the problems I face, (because anything novel will be totally different/ radical than what was before hence you'd need to design everything from scratch) <!--and if the market validates, I mean if there is traction, I can start running the machine.-->
