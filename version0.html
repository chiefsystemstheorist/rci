<br> \[2\] As end-consumers we consume a lot of diverse content across a number of platforms, and bookmarking is an inherent behaviour in users. 




<br> But, Reading apps are where a set of people go to first thing they open their phone. 
<br>

<br> From the publisher's PoV, (publisher's = individual creators (people and pages)), they have to keep posting (that too consistently) according to the algorithm of that aggregator 
<br>(1) to get picked up by the algorithm, to be shown in more no. of feeds (feeds of users who might find it relevant) and 
<br>(2) to get ranked in the 1st page. Also, in social-media platforms, publisher's posts might get lost in the feed. [[n1]]
<br> But, Email is a direct relationship with the reader. Hence, Newsletters > having to get ranked in a feed (social-media platforms and SERPs).

<br> publishers - (b) It can be written anywhere and reposted any number of aggregators, but
<br>
<br> but,.. readers have a seperate place to read it. they call it reading apps. 
<br> read-later - pocket, instapaper, diigo, abyss.



<br> Readers(most) don't go to the website directly. They'd read it wherever they found it (feed, mail app) (or) save it for later. 
<br> they have dedicated apps to read articles and pdfs that they saved to them. but then all other sorts of text-first content can only be bookmarked, they cannot be brought to a more centralised information system. 


<br>We get our links from one of these 3 places - 
<br>anywhere = {
<br> [1] Feeds (social-meida platforms & discovery apps) //Feeds =  twitter, linkedin, reddit, tumblr, instagram, facebook
<br> [2] Newsletters 
<br> [3] Browsing(SERPs and backlinks)
<br> }
<br> all sorts of text content can be segmented based on where it is posted,
<br> (1) articles, pdfs
<br> (2) (tweets, linkedin posts, reddit posts, quora answers & posts, facebook posts, captions in Instagram, Tumblr posts.etc)

<br> You may get your links from anywhere, but for some people, reading apps are the final destination where they consume the content they saved for later.  
<br>


<br>
<br> we have a various reasons why we want to those links. 
<br> why we bookmark ? <a href="https://bytebaker.com/2010/10/05/why-bookmark/">link</a>
<br> I made 3 buckets - just-in-case, unread, read.
<br> Each reason is a persona in itself and I'll get into it slowly.
<br>
<br> [1] seems interesting (just-in-case) - just open it in background and leave it to rot \[ unread \]
FOMO
<br> [2] Things you want to get back to, like for sure. (reading queue) - \[ unread / started \]

<br> It seems you'll start dumping articles into read-later apps, just-in-case you need it later. Users are frustrated, they cannot keep up with their hoarding habit. We hoard articles and never get back to them. Links are dying everyday.

<!---->
<br> I believe making this the best place to read by fixing the current problem of pocket being a dump, would be the starting point as told before.
<br> I think it’s more that nearly everyone at tech – and I’ve witnessed this first hand again and again – is deeply conditioned to think at scale. It is the first question out of anyone’s mouth when it comes to a new service or product – “Can it scale?” Niches, though, don’t scale; they go deep. More importantly, they go deep in a way that wasn’t possible previously.
<br>
<br>Instead, Ellis had found a leading indicator: just ask users “how would you feel if you could no longer use the product?” and measure the percent who answer “very disappointed.”
This is a very powerful question, as happy users will almost always describe themselves, not other people, using the words that matter most to them. This lets you know who the product is working for and the language that resonates with them (providing valuable kernels of insight for your marketing copy as well).
<br>These words of wisdom from Paul Graham explain why:
<br>“When a startup launches, there have to be at least some users who really need what they're making — not just people who could see themselves using it one day, but who want it urgently. Usually this initial group of users is small, for the simple reason that if there were something that large numbers of people urgently needed and that could be built with the amount of effort a startup usually puts into a version one, it would probably already exist. Which means you have to compromise on one dimension: you can either build something a large number of people want a small amount, or something a small number of people want a large amount. Choose the latter. Not all ideas of that type are good startup ideas, but nearly all good startup ideas are of that type.”

<!---->
<br>I guess I consider these tweets as validation (couldn't do proper user-research) that all reading apps have so much room to grow. 
<br> I'm still not sure if a social-layer over reading would work out (as in google reader).

EPISODE SUMMARY
Status can be a volatile, powerful driver of engagement. Status and one of its underlying mechanisms, scarcity must be considered by product designers in every category, as early on as possible. But it can also be a double-edged sword, as managing a network and the status dynamics within it is constantly recirculating, always shifting. For this reason, status that is more entertainment-based than utility-based can over time become precarious, as well as too restrictive for continued user growth. (replaceable)









<br> I'll explain breifly -
<br> not very utilitarian, most of it is entertainment-based 
<br>Eugene Wei (10:06):
<br>Many people think that their products are very utilitarian. And I'd argue that a lot of products that people build are actually entertainment based products. And the reason this is important, this distinction, is that I think in the modern world, because of the smartphone being always connected to the internet, holding a whole bunch of different apps of all different types, what we're seeing is a collapse of the barriers that used to separate different forms of entertainment into their own sort of vertical.
<br>Eugene Wei (13:11):
<br>So I think it's very critical if you're doing a startup to understand if you are going to be offering a product that is an entertainment-based product, because that really changes your competitive set. I'd argue a lot of things like, if you're going to go argue politics with people on Twitter, people think of that as something heavy and serious, but I think that's just another form of entertainment. And so social media, ultimately, a lot of it is just about entertainment, not utility. And that's just more precarious ground to be on than say, if you were truly a utility-based network. 
<br>
<br>
<br> for them, reasons to open the app is divided between utility and entertainment.
<br> And this is the problem they have, based on a utilitarian perspective.
<br> Them using it is based on whatever they see it as, (utility or entertainment) and, what everyone else perceives it also has an influence on the user's perception of the app.

<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:black;background-color:black">

entertainment-based / status axis
--


<br> utlimately, users are playing the game knowingly or unknowingly. 
<br>[[<a href ="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service">status as a service - eugene wei</a>]]
<br>As with cryptocurrency, if it were so easy, it wouldn't be worth anything.<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Value is tied to scarcity, and scarcity on social networks derives from proof of work. Status isn't worth much if there's no skill and effort required to mine it. It's not that a social network that makes it easy for lots of users to perform well can't be a useful one, but competition for relative status still motivates humans.</span> Recall our first tenet: humans are status-seeking monkeys. Status is a relative ladder. By definition, if everyone can achieve a certain type of status, it’s no status at all, it’s a participation trophy.
<br>
<br>Almost every social network of note had an early signature proof of work hurdle. For Facebook it was posting some witty text-based status update. For Instagram, it was posting an interesting square photo. For Vine, an entertaining 6-second video. For Twitter, it was writing an amusing bit of text of 140 characters or fewer. Pinterest? Pinning a compelling photo. You can likely derive the proof of work for other networks like Quora and Reddit and Twitch and so on. Successful social networks don't pose trick questions at the start, it’s usually clear what they want from you.



<br>James Currier (14:17):
<br>Right. And ultimately, I think we've heard this before, but it's competing for our attention. It's competing for our time. And ultimately there's only a certain number of hours in the day. And so as we look at a world of the internet or of Chinese manufacturing with sort of an infinitude of anything you might want, as we move to the infinity, then really we're looking for scarcity. And scarcity is created by the number of hours in the day, for instance.
<br>James Currier (16:40):
<br>As we look at the gamification of everything, we realized that the world had been gamified before with U.S. News & World Report publishing the list of colleges in 1981, which has set off this mad, crazy game about getting into college and achieving status and that sort of thing. They created this scarcity. Who's number one? Who's in the top 10? Who's in the top 50? What other ways are you seeing people create scarcity that then produces energy for people or produces businesses?




<br>Now consider, reading articles as entertainment. It seems like we have certain expectations when we read something (utility), but we could also call it entertainment, as not all of us go great lengths to retain what we read. We don't have a clear metric to measure this sort of proof of work. 
<!--According to me, We only read to know just enough. maybe just for the sake of bragging rights, or to win arguments, or for n unknown reasons.
But what is clear is, since we read (consume) a lot of content, by default unless until we go back to it, we might not be able to understand it completely yet.-->

<br>goal - get more stuff read
<br>    stats for gamification is not simply taking your product and adding points, levels, trophies, and badges. Well, researchers distinguished intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. With intrinsic motivation, we do things because we find them inherently satisfying and interesting. With extrinsic motivation, we do things to achieve rewards. And that’s the problem with rewards – they massively undermine intrinsic motivation. This is also why gamification does not work. When gamification appears to work, it is because the underlying experience is already a game.
<br>
<br>if the user is able to correlate simply roaming inside the app or staying inside longer as being productive or reading more or learning more, we win.
<br>
<br>incentive to read - leaderboards (social-capital)
<br>children might mark them as read, just to show off. The system might get gamed
<br>"as Mr. Munger says, people tend to game any system you put in place, and then they tend to rationalize that gaming until they believe they really are doing the right thing. I think it was Andy Grove who said that for every goal you put in front of someone, you should also put in place a counter-goal to restrict gaming of the first goal. 
<br> end of the day, who are they fooling ? Hence, only those who come for the utility 
<br>disincentive - 

<br>
<br>/3 What is the simplest behaviour in anticipation of reward ?
<br> I'll give 2 answers, in terms of clout.
<br>(1) the power-user is there for our prioritization first. He really wants to reach pocket zero (zero unread articles) and doesn't give a damn about if he gets any clout out of the nerd he is. 
<br>(2) average users now with leaderboards have this incentive to read, as them reading could be visualised into clout as in github's 365-day coding streak and shades based on certain proof of work.
<br> buffer as deadline and for accountability
<br>
<br>Eugene Wei (02:32):
<br> I actually think that people in the gaming world have more of an intuitive understanding of how important it is, moment to moment, to track your user's emotional valence. And that's partially because game designers sort of... Games are a continuous interactive experiences. 
<br>Eugene Wei (03:24):
<br>And if the user isn't feeling the right balance of challenged, plus motivated, plus rewarded in a game, they'll churn out. But I think that same principle can be applied to a lot of other products. How products take off a lot of it is in how they make you feel. If you watch any Apple keynote, going back to the Steve Jobs days, I think he is underrated for having this very intuitive understanding. That part of why people should buy Apple products or part of why they buy Apple products is that it makes them feel cool or it makes them feel hip, or it makes them feel creative. That applies to social networks just as much.
<br>Eugene Wei (04:25):
<br>That's a tough question to answer. Part of it may just be mental frameworks that are more common in business and analysis tend to be more focused on things that are measurable or easily measured, which often is some sort of utility based function. And it is harder sometimes to measure that emotional quality. What emotional payoff does your product have? You may have to actually sit in a focus group and watch the body language of someone to really understand that. But often it's just in their minds, in their heads. And so the downstream metrics that capture that are sort of a little too late in the game, or we don't connect them back upstream to a user's state of mind.

<br>// aggregating readlists of some of the greatest people (set of quality users in a controlled environment) 
<br>better SERPs (basic logic that my friend who knows about it can guide me better than GOOG). Searching those keywords inside the reading lists of people you follow here would give better results than google, but the user is still in an echochamber.

\[1\] search - SERPs /consensus/

<br> assuming the users of reading apps wouldn't have saved generic content, it could be said that searching inside bookmarks would by default give better results than google. / Think of the search bar in news.ycombinator.com/
<br> 'Articles' can be broken down based on shelf life and word count.
my assumption is only those with shelf life greater than a day to a week, get bookmarked.

<br> And, the use of query-modifiers is enough validation that, Google is not serving quality content. It has more generic SEO-centric content in it SERPs.

<br> One interesting pattern I found among readers in twitter is that, quality pieces of content they come across in their feeds cannot be found in google search results, by a noob who is trying to learn that topic. 
<br> Only because they follow certain people on twitter, they’re able to access such content and google cannot give you that, as it unnecessarily searches through a lot of noise and that too only based on the combinations of keywords you enter (this is a skill in itself). Maybe I'm not articulating it properly. It seems it's like Google is running a contest to decide who should be shown in the 1st page of SERPs (have temporary ownership over certain keyword 
combinations) in Google's state-of-the-art Search Engine.

<br> (1) The byproduct of the pursuit of a great product idea, is the content or more like copy, you could use for distribution, to build conviction. 
<br> (2) A beta-list maybe. Build a killer feature-set based on the problems I face, (because anything novel will be totally different/ radical than what was before hence you'd need to design everything from scratch) <!--and if the market validates, I mean if there is traction, I can start running the machine.-->
