<br> The Internet basically democratized a lot of things. It reduced the information assymmetry, but we're creating and consuming content at an unimaginable rate.

<!--<br>opening new tabs(thought-trains) is the default behaviour.

<br> It is not about reading the content of one page and going on to the next. 
<br> It is about gathering the relevant data in the sea of nonsense, and leaving the tabs open, « in working  memory », until the gathered data 
<br> // All the tabs that are open are not open because people forget to close them. Instead, they act like living bookmarks. They are keys to thoughts and ideas, that you want to return to and continue thinking.

<br> Web pages that we visit and leave open are artifacts of externalized cognition; keys to thinking and remembering. The browser of today is a transitory space that brings us into a mental state, not just to a specific website destination. And we should design our browsers for this task.
<br>[[<a href="https://rybakov.com/blog/open_tabs_are_cognitive_spaces">Tabs are cognitive spaces</a>]]

<!-- solving for the overload -->
<br>
<br> \[2\] [bookmarking is an inherent behaviour in users]
<br> As end-consumers we consume a lot of diverse content across a number of platforms. 
<br> Bookmark function in social networks, is for things the user wants to get his/her attention back to, is spread across a wide spectrum of apps. But they’re all silos of knowledge you gathered. 
<br> Aggregating all these silos and pooling it all into one place is a natural thought. But, it's not possible unless they give APIs.
<br>
<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:black;background-color:black">
<br>I guess I consider these tweets as validation that all reading apps have so much room to grow.


<br> we have a various reasons why we want to those links. 
<br> I made 3 buckets - just-in-case, unread, read. 
<br> why we bookmark ? <a href="https://bytebaker.com/2010/10/05/why-bookmark/">link</a>
<br> [1] seems interesting (just-in-case) - just open it in background and leave it to rot \[ unread \]
FOMO
<br> [2] Things you want to get back to, like for sure. (reading queue) - \[ unread / started \]
<br> [3] Text that makes you say "nobody put it this way" - for future reference 
\[ read \]
<br> Each reason is a persona in itself and I'll get into it slowly.
<br>
<!-- just-in-case -->
<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:black;background-color:black">
<br> [1]
<br> It seems you'll start dumping articles into read-later apps, just-in-case you need it later. Users are frustrated, they cannot keep up with their hoarding habit. We hoard articles and never get back to them. Links are dying everyday.
<br> we save more than we actually read, and that is because we find everything so enticing.
<br> there is another mode of reading - just-in-time, wherein we keep searching until a task is done. A rabbit hole but with a purpose and clear outcomes.

<h4> why curation is not the problem of the century</h4> 
<br> We have so much of great content, but we lack the discipline to actually finish them and but some people have actually succeeded in getting more out of this random consumption. 
<!--We cannot classify all this randomness. The algorithm learns based on how we search, it then learns enough to show us a randomized feed of what we might like and we're addicted to it. We forget that, we're the ones who started with randomness and that we could acknowledge the fact that we're living in echochambers.-->
<br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A Substack of carefully selected links and analysis is helpful, but not if everyone is pushing one.<br><br>Curation is content in itself, masked as a service.</p>&mdash; Matt Klein (@KleinKleinKlein) <a href="https://twitter.com/KleinKleinKlein/status/1340751191572135941?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 20, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New idea from a blog post that has been on my mind a lot the last month: that info overload is not due to filter failure, but filter success. Everything is so good now (or at least alluring) it’s hard to turn away. And having better filters only makes that problem worse</p>&mdash; Tiago Forte (@fortelabs) <a href="https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1075294724330831872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<br>curation is not the problem, I'm trying to solve,...
<br> It's hard to know which ones are worthwhile before consuming it. 
<br> For quickly deciding what to read and what to skip, which are more of a priority and which ones you could afford to miss out
<br> It's not signal v. noise. Almost always every article might be equally interesting and you'll be having a hard time saying no to it.
<br> since by default everything that comes inside the reading app is chosen by you, by default everything that comes in is considered a signal, and it's our job to figure which ones might be a great read.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">But no matter how good an algorithm is, when the supply is saturated with noise, it drowns out the signal.</p>&mdash; SPENCER (@SP1NS1R) <a href="https://twitter.com/SP1NS1R/status/1275820530688352263?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 24, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<br> things we could do -
<br> [] optimal save limit 
<br> [] At the time of bookmarking itself we can ask him for inputs ? we might get to know how important it is to him.
<br> When the user gives contextual inputs like for the author, for the blog, for the headline, all three.,, or something similar, that tries to capture as much info as possible for the algorithm to decide how important it is to the user,, it becomes easier to prioritize.
<br> When saving it, we try to put it under a folder and add appropriate hashtags for us to be able to access it easily the next time around. (power-user)
<br> establish intent clearly before getting it inside the information system (i.e, Pocket). Sometimes so clear that they have to set aside time to read this, they go on to schedule it on their calendar app.
<br> [] archived, but searchable

<br> I believe making this the best place to read by fixing the current problem of pocket being a dump, would be the starting point as told before.

<br>bonus-points 
<br>// aggregating readlists of some of the greatest people (set of quality users in a controlled environment) 
<br>better SERPs (basic logic that my friend who knows about it can guide me better than GOOG). Searching those keywords inside the reading lists of people you follow here would give better results than google, but the user is still in an echochamber.
<br>\[1\] search - SERPs /consensus/
<br><p style="color:red;"> search in consumption app (reading app) /platform </p>
<br> assuming the users of reading apps wouldn't have saved generic content, it could be said that searching inside bookmarks would by default give better results than google. / Think of the search bar in news.ycombinator.com/
<br> 'Articles' can be broken down based on shelf life and word count.
my assumption is only those with shelf life greater than a day to a week, get bookmarked.
<br> <a href="https://dcgross.com/a-new-google">A New Google - dcgross.com | December 2020</a>
<br> And, the use of query-modifiers is enough validation that, Google is not serving quality content. It has more generic SEO-centric content in it SERPs.
<br> <a href="https://dcgross.com/a-new-google">A New Google - dcgross.com | December 2020</a>
<br>
<br> One interesting pattern I found among readers in twitter is that, quality pieces of content they come across in their feeds cannot be found in google search results, by a noob who is trying to learn that topic. 
<br> Only because they follow certain people on twitter, they’re able to access such content and google cannot give you that, as it unnecessarily searches through a lot of noise and that too only based on the combinations of keywords you enter (this is a skill in itself). Maybe I'm not articulating it properly. It seems it's like Google is running a contest to decide who >should be shown in the 1st page of SERPs (have temporary ownership over certain keyword combinations) in Google's state-of-the-art Search Engine.  
<br> is this scarcity ? maybe.






<br>
<br> barrier to entry - only those who read might be regular users of reading apps. 
<br> 2 personas - 
<br> (i) those who read (power user)
<br> (ii) those who want to read (average user)
<br> intentions may differ, but the goal is clear.
<br>
<br>goal - 
<br>(i) power-user - actually get more stuff read 
<br>(ii) average-user - if the user is able to correlate simply roaming inside the app or staying inside longer as being productive or reading more or learning more, we win. 
<br> but, that is just to hook him, like get him started and eventually if he truly believes in consistency (compound effect n shit), he might actually become an evangelist.
<br>
<br>/3 What is the simplest behaviour in anticipation of reward ?
<br>(1) the power-user is there for our prioritization first. He really wants to reach pocket zero and doesn't give a damn about if he gets any clout out of the nerd he is. 
<br>(2) average users now with leaderboards have this incentive to read, as them reading could be visualised into clout as in github's 365-day coding streak and shades based on certain proof of work.

<!--<br> stats for gamification is not simply taking your product and adding points, levels, trophies, and badges. Well, researchers distinguished intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. With intrinsic motivation, we do things because we find them inherently satisfying and interesting. With extrinsic motivation, we do things to achieve rewards. And that’s the problem with rewards – they massively undermine intrinsic motivation. This is also why gamification does not work. When gamification appears to work, it is because the underlying experience is already a game.-->

<br>Eugene Wei (02:32):
<br> I actually think that people in the gaming world have more of an intuitive understanding of how important it is, moment to moment, to track your user's emotional valence. And that's partially because game designers sort of... Games are a continuous interactive experiences. 
<br>Eugene Wei (03:24):
<br>And if the user isn't feeling the right balance of challenged, plus motivated, plus rewarded in a game, they'll churn out. But I think that same principle can be applied to a lot of other products. How products take off a lot of it is in how they make you feel. If you watch any Apple keynote, going back to the Steve Jobs days, I think he is underrated for having this very intuitive understanding. That part of why people should buy Apple products or part of why they buy Apple products is that it makes them feel cool or it makes them feel hip, or it makes them feel creative. That applies to social networks just as much.

<br> I've become rather fascinated by all the people trying to unbundle Yelp for restaurants. People trying to unbundle Craigslist do so with modern UX, but Yelp is a modern company with modern UX, and the people unbundling it, mostly, use constraint. Instead of offering 500 or 1000 restaurants and a search box, they give you a list - 50, or 10, or even 1. Sometimes this is deliberate and sometimes it flows from the business model, but the result is the same - they remove the 'tyranny of choice'. I don't want 500 options for restaurants, all of which I'd like - I want five.
