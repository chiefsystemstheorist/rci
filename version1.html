<br> \[1\] social-capital /alterego, opendm/ 

<br>It seems like everyone are trying to control the algorithm to a certain extent.
<br>Users are optimizing their social/online presence for something. 
<br>for social-capital(clout / reputation) & creator monetisation(building an audience, managing a communities)
<br>
<br>	Eugene Wei (33:20):
<br>	I certainly think there's something to the idea that humans are wired to be very, very conscious of status. And that it may have come from another time in mankind's history when your status within your small tribe or group was actually critical to your survival.
<br>

<br>

<br>	clout and social-capital (status as a service)
<br>I believe Instagram could unbundle into micro-blogging platform. The days of text-first social capital is long gone, but let me see if there is scope for it. text-first means captions get all the attention, not that mercedes you have in your picture or how cool you made the picture look like. Google Reader will be missed forever it seems. If not for Twitter and FB, you‚Äôd still be alive. Maybe you had to go, to make way for twitter and newer forms of social capital. Which now, clearly seems to be being in the ‚Äòfollowed by speakers‚Äô section of any chat room you wish to talk in clubhouse.
<br>	
<br> We all are status seeing monkeys. We keep judging things as higher in status and either become an admirer or envy it, and start thinking, how to perform better to reach higher status. [[Tim Urban - Wait but Why ?]]
<br>	we keep seeking validation
<br>    The Internt will accept your weirdness. Consumers are navigating away from mainstream markets and that is why they say, profitability will improve for the long tail / niches. 
<br>	scaling intimacy 
<br>	friction to publish (because we all are playing different games)
<br>
<br> as network effects kick in, it'd start looking like all the people you give a fuck about will be there. I mean we joined every social-platform because our friends did, and then for the content. vice-versa is also true.
<!-- after onboarding is done -->
<br>why do they come here in the first place (social-media platforms) - 
<br>
<br> [\] for content posted by your friends(people) or pages(publishers) and to connect with friends
<br> [\] for building an audience [every creator is a political party - cult x political party][[<a href="https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/">1,000 True Fans? Try 100 by Li Jin</a>]] or
<br> [\] for making friends on the internet and communities, for that social-connection part, or more like trying to find your tribe, as said in 'We're all tribes' - by seth godin.
<br> those who play well, can climb up the ladder. 
<br> Game being people judge you based on the content you create and reward you.
















<!-- mining social-capital -->
Clubhouse, clearly seems to increase the user's social-capital by him just be being in the ‚Äòfollowed by speakers‚Äô section of a chatroom.

<br>Clubhouse basically swallowed Twitter, when it comes to serendipity and building an audience.
<br>But I keep wondering how clubhouse is going to compete with platforms with scale like Twitter..,, most probably followed byzuck & co.
<br>Instagram followed by WhatsApp where local aunties might begossiping in a chat room.
<br>simulating an offline event, online and more specifically how networking happens online. Discord x Airmeet vs. clubhouse

me: Hey Norman,
Transcripts are available for a lot of great podcasts, but (a) we don‚Äôt know which podcasts have transcripts 
(b) transcripts are not in article format - mostly shown inside the app.
I've been thinking about this lately and it seems like if there was a site that aggregated transcripts to podcasts and even interviews on YouTube, wouldn't it benefit a lot of ppl.
can you give me your thoughts on this ?

him: Hey there I'm so sorry that I'm late to this - DMs have been swamped as of late. I can give a few thoughts though there are already people working on this (podcastnotes and listennotes come to mind, they're a huge repurposor of transcripts turning it into useful content)
It does benefit people, not only from an accessibility perspective but also from a consumer's perspective - not always do we want to listen to the full show but rather read the transcript from one section of it. This is a good way to parse through the conversation.
The problem is yes like you said, (A): automatic transcripts are not always accurate and cater for people with accents, and it's expensive to do manual transcriptions. 
B is app dependent AND host platform dependent: only a few hosting platforms like Buzzsprout, Captivate (I think), Libsyn, etc. have a section on transcriptions. Even then, the app that pulls them may not have a section for transcripts as well. Then comes podcaster's behavior: Even if we have the transcript, where should we put them? 1 is to have your own website to upload it, and another is hopefully if the hosting platform comes with an automated website then hopefully that will pop up as well.
If that works, then yes you can repurpose transcriptions in your own way as a podcaster. Still a lot of work haha.
If there's a way to repurpose transcriptions automatically into content from the podcaster's side that works in parallel with their posted episode then there's a way to marry all of that together into one premium workflow
<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br> audio rooms truly seem like the future of bringing consensus. In clubhouse's case, contribution, moderation are the games, as far as I know.
<br> /clubhouse has all the attention/, but it only has one game to play - speaking. 
<br>
<br>	Now, it's like we're holding a mic in front of strangers (or) we feel like we have a mic in our hand 
<br>	we need to identify ourselves with something, pick a flag or get called half-baked.
<!--<br>	we are being watched, and why I started recording was because I felt there was accountability or a need to perform better in front of others-->
<br>	we are only aligning according to our beliefs, ideologies, faiths, stories and schools of thought.
